"Q:A 45-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of difficulty swallowing that has worsened over the past year. He also reports some hoarseness and generalized bone, muscle, and joint pain. During the past six months, he has had progressive constipation and two episodes of kidney stones. He also reports recurrent episodes of throbbing headaches, diaphoresis, and palpitations. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. He takes no medications. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination and an ECG show no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show calcium concentration of 12 mg/dL, phosphorus concentration of 2 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase concentration of 100 U/L, and calcitonin concentration of 11 pg/mL (N < 8.8). Ultrasonography of the neck shows hypoechoic thyroid lesions with irregular margins and microcalcifications. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition??

Based on the patient's symptoms of difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, bone/muscle/joint pain, constipation, kidney stones, headaches, sweating, palpitations, elevated calcium and calcitonin levels, and thyroid nodules on ultrasound, the most likely diagnosis is hyperparathyroidism due to a parathyroid adenoma. 
The parathyroid glands regulate calcium homeostasis by secreting parathyroid hormone (PTH). Overproduction of PTH leads to hypercalcemia. This causes the constellation of neuromuscular, gastrointestinal, renal, and skeletal symptoms described. Elevated serum calcium and PTH levels confirm the diagnosis. Thyroid nodules can sometimes co-occur but are not the primary pathology.
The other answer choices describe genetic conditions that may present with some shared features, but do not explain the full clinical picture:
A) NF1 - presents with neurofibromas, not hypercalcemia 
B) Radiation exposure - could cause thyroid nodules but not hyperparathyroidism
C) VHL - associated with tumors in specific locations, not hypercalcemia
D) RET proto-oncogene - could cause thyroid nodules but not hyperparathyroidism
E) Menin - causes endocrine tumors but not hypercalcemia

This is a clinical vignette describing a 45-year-old man with progressive difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, bone/muscle/joint pain, constipation, kidney stones, headaches, sweating, and palpitations over the past year. Lab tests show elevated calcium, low phosphorus, normal alkaline phosphatase, and elevated calcitonin. Imaging shows hypoechoic thyroid lesions. 

The key findings are the elevated calcitonin level, hypoechoic thyroid lesions, and family history of thyroid cancer. This suggests a parathyroid adenoma as the most likely diagnosis. 

The choices describe various genetic syndromes. NF1, VHL, and menin syndromes do not explain the parathyroid findings. Exposure to radiation could cause thyroid cancer but not the other findings. The RET proto-oncogene is involved in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A, which can present with parathyroid adenoma.

"Q:A 62-year-old woman is hospitalized after a recent viral illness complicated by congestive heart failure. She has a past medical history of obesity and hypertension controlled on lisinopril but was otherwise healthy until she developed fatigue and edema after a recent viral illness. In the hospital, she is started on furosemide to manage her fluid status. On day 5 of her admission, the patient’s temperature is 100.0°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 136/88 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 14/min. The patient continues to have normal heart sounds, but with crackles bilaterally on lung auscultation. Edema is 3+ up to the bilateral knees. On labs, her leukocyte count is now 13,000/mm^3, up from 9,000/mm^3 the day before. Differential shows that this includes 1,000 eosinophils/mm^3. Creatinine is 1.7 mg/dL from 1.0 mg/dL the day before. Which of the following is most likely expected on urinary analysis??

This is a clinical vignette about a 62-year-old woman hospitalized for congestive heart failure who develops a fever, leukocytosis with eosinophilia, and worsening renal function while on furosemide. The question asks which urinary analysis finding would be most expected in this scenario.

The key findings in the vignette are the recent use of furosemide, a loop diuretic, along with the patient's worsening renal function as evidenced by the increased creatinine. Furosemide can cause acute interstitial nephritis, which can present with fever, eosinophilia, and worsened renal function. Interstitial nephritis classically causes sterile pyuria, which would be detected as leukocyte esterase positive on urinalysis. 

Of the choices given, leukocyte esterase positive would be the most likely urinary analysis finding in this clinical scenario. Bacteria, crystals, nitrites, and RBC casts would not be expected.

This is a clinical vignette about a 62-year-old woman hospitalized for congestive heart failure who develops a fever, leukocytosis with eosinophilia, and worsening renal function while on furosemide. The question asks which urinary analysis finding would be most expected in this scenario.

The key findings in the vignette are the recent use of furosemide, a loop diuretic, along with the patient's worsening renal function as evidenced by the increased creatinine. Furosemide can cause acute interstitial nephritis, which can present with fever, eosinophilia, and worsened renal function. Interstitial nephritis classically causes sterile pyuria, which would be detected as leukocyte esterase positive on urinalysis. 

Of the choices given, leukocyte esterase positive would be the most likely urinary analysis finding in this clinical scenario. Bacteria, crystals, nitrites, and RBC casts would not be expected.

C: Leukocyte esterase positive

This is a clinical vignette describing a 62-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure who is hospitalized after a viral illness. She is started on furosemide and develops fever, crackles on lung exam, and edema, suggesting acute exacerbation of her congestive heart failure. Her leukocytosis with eosinophilia and elevated creatinine indicate possible acute kidney injury. 

The question asks which of the following is most likely expected on urinalysis in this patient. Based on the clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), which can occur as a complication of certain medications like furosemide. AIN is characterized by eosinophil-mediated inflammation and edema in the renal interstitium. This would be expected to show eosinophiluria on urinalysis.

This is a clinical case scenario involving a 16-year-old girl with jaundice (yellowish discoloration of the eyes) and fatigue after returning from a trip to Guatemala. She had diarrhea, nausea, and appetite loss while in Guatemala that resolved. She also took primaquine for malaria prophylaxis. Three weeks ago, she had a UTI treated with nitrofurantoin. On exam, she has scleral icterus (yellow discoloration of the eyes) but no lymphadenopathy. Lab tests show elevated total bilirubin, normal direct bilirubin, normal liver enzymes, and positive anti-HAV IgG. 

The key findings here are the jaundice after resolving an illness in a foreign country, the positive anti-HAV IgG, and the normal direct bilirubin. This indicates a hemolytic process leading to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, most consistent with Gilbert's syndrome. The other options can be ruled out based on the lab results and clinical presentation.

"Q:A previously healthy 28-year-old woman comes to the physician because of lower abdominal pain and purulent vaginal discharge for the past 5 days. Menses occur at irregular 20 to 40-day intervals and last 4 to 8 days. She is sexually active with a new partner that she met 2 months ago and they use condoms inconsistently. She had a normal pap smear 5 months ago. She drinks 2 beers every other day. Her temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), pulse is 85/min, and blood pressure is 108/75 mm Hg. Examination shows lower abdominal tenderness and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. Pelvic examination is notable for uterine and adnexal tenderness as well as small amounts of bloody cervical discharge. A spot urine pregnancy test is negative.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 28-year-old woman with lower abdominal pain, purulent vaginal discharge, irregular menstrual cycles, recent new sexual partner, high fever, lymphadenopathy, uterine/adnexal tenderness, and bloody cervical discharge. Lab tests show leukocytosis and high ESR. Nucleic acid amplification has confirmed the diagnosis, which based on the clinical presentation is most likely pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) caused by a sexually transmitted infection like chlamydia or gonorrhea. She has been started on appropriate antibiotics. The next step should be to test for other sexually transmitted infections that may be concurrent, especially HIV given the high-risk sexual history.

This is a patient with lower abdominal pain, purulent vaginal discharge, irregular menstrual cycles, new sexual partner, and lymphadenopathy. The description of bloody cervical discharge and uterine/adnexal tenderness on exam are concerning for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The lab results show an elevated white blood cell count and ESR, also consistent with inflammation. Nucleic acid amplification confirms the diagnosis of PID. 

The next step should be to evaluate for complications of PID, such as ectopic pregnancy or pelvic abscess. A CT scan of the abdomen would not be appropriate next step. A Tzanck smear is used to diagnose herpes simplex virus infection, which is not supported by the clinical presentation. Colposcopy and Pap smear are not indicated at this time. An HIV test is not routinely indicated in a patient with PID.

"Q:A 2-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of a 5-minute episode of repetitive, involuntary, twitching movements of his left arm that occurred 1 hour ago. His symptoms began while playing with some toys. His parents say that he began to stand with support at 18 months and has recently started to walk with support. He speaks in bisyllables. He is at the 70th percentile for length and 80th percentile for weight. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a purple-pink patch over the right cheek that extends to the right eyelid. The right eyeball is firm. Neurologic examination shows left arm hypotonia and absent bicep reflex on the left side. Fundoscopy shows cupping of the right optic disc.

Based on the information provided in the question stem, this 2-year-old boy has presented with a brief episode of involuntary twitching movements (seizure) in his left arm, as well as delayed motor milestones, speech delay, a facial skin lesion, left arm hypotonia, absent left bicep reflex, and optic disc changes. 

The seizure, motor delays, speech delay, and left-sided neurologic findings suggest a neurological disorder affecting the right side of the brain. The facial skin lesion and optic disc changes point towards a diagnosis involving vascular/angiomatous abnormalities. 

Of the choices provided, Sturge-Weber syndrome, also known as encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis, is characterized by facial cutaneous vascular malformations (port-wine stain), leptomeningeal angiomas, and eye abnormalities often leading to glaucoma. This explains the patient's facial lesion, optic disc changes, and right-sided neurologic abnormalities. The other answer choices do not fit the constellation of this patient's clinical presentation.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 2-year-old boy with a history of developmental delay presenting with an acute episode of involuntary twitching movements in his left arm. Key findings include a purple-pink patch over the right cheek extending to the eyelid, right optic disc cupping, and left arm hypotonia and absent bicep reflex. 

The differential diagnosis includes vascular malformations like Sturge-Weber syndrome, neurocutaneous syndromes like neurofibromatosis type 1, and other causes of focal neurological deficits. However, the presence of the facial angiomas and optic disc findings points towards Sturge-Weber syndrome as the most likely diagnosis.

"Q:A 29-year-old G1P0 female at 32 weeks gestation presents to the emergency department with vaginal bleeding. She has had minimal prenatal care to-date with only an initial visit with an obstetrician after a positive home pregnancy test. She describes minimal spotting that she noticed earlier today that has progressed to larger amounts of blood; she estimates 30 mL of blood loss. She denies any cramping, pain, or contractions, and she reports feeling continued movements of the baby. Ultrasound and fetal heart rate monitoring confirm the presence of a healthy fetus without any evidence of current or impending complications. The consulted obstetrician orders blood testing for Rh-status of both the mother as well as the father, who brought the patient to the hospital.

This is a question about managing Rh sensitization in pregnancy. The key points are:
- The patient is Rh-negative.
- The father's Rh status is unknown. 
- The patient has vaginal bleeding in the third trimester.
- Fetal wellbeing has been confirmed.

The main concern is the potential for fetal-maternal hemorrhage to cause Rh sensitization if the father is Rh-positive. RhoGAM prevents this by binding any fetal Rh-positive red blood cells that enter maternal circulation. It should be given to Rh-negative mothers in cases of potential sensitizing events.
</analysis>
<answer>
A: If mother is Rh-negative and father is Rh-positive then administer RhoGAM

This is a question about managing Rh sensitization in pregnancy. The key details are that the mother is Rh-negative and the father's Rh status is unknown. The patient is in her third trimester at 32 weeks gestation and has had vaginal bleeding. The goal is to determine if RhoGAM should be given to prevent Rh sensitization and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 47-year-old man with acute onset urinary and fecal incontinence after a fall and back injury earlier in the day. Key findings include lower back tenderness, bilateral lower extremity weakness, absent ankle reflexes with preserved patellar reflexes, and decreased rectal tone with a full bladder on ultrasound. 

The differential diagnosis includes spinal cord injury syndromes. Choice A spinal epidural abscess is less likely in this acute presentation without constitutional symptoms like fever. Choice B cerebellar stroke would not cause these spinal cord findings. Choice D anterior spinal cord syndrome is incorrect because patellar reflexes are preserved, suggesting the injury is lower in the spinal cord. Choice E Brown-Sequard syndrome is the closest but does not explain the bilateral lower extremity weakness. 

Choice C conus medullaris syndrome is the most likely diagnosis given the acute urinary and fecal incontinence from sacral spinal cord injury after trauma, with bilateral lower extremity weakness, absent ankle reflexes, and preserved patellar reflexes. The conus medullaris is the tapered end of the spinal cord that contains the sacral spinal cord segments.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 47-year-old man with acute onset urinary and fecal incontinence after a fall and back injury earlier in the day. Key findings include lower back tenderness, bilateral lower extremity weakness, absent ankle reflexes, preserved patellar reflexes, and decreased rectal tone with a full bladder on ultrasound. 

The differential diagnosis includes spinal cord injury syndromes. Based on the acute onset of urinary and fecal incontinence after trauma, the most likely diagnosis is conus medullaris syndrome. Spinal epidural abscess would cause back pain but not acute incontinence. Cerebellar stroke would not cause lower extremity weakness or absent ankle reflexes. Anterior spinal cord syndrome would cause preserved patellar reflexes. Brown-Sequard syndrome involves ipsilateral weakness and contralateral loss of pain/temperature sensation, which is not described here.

This is a question about identifying laboratory findings associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient was involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision and has signs of severe pelvic trauma, significant blood loss, and evidence of DIC based on the lab results showing decreased platelets, prolonged PT/PTT, and elevated D-dimer. DIC results in widespread microvascular thrombosis and consumption of clotting factors and platelets. The peripheral blood smear in DIC would be most likely to show schistocytes, which are fragmented red blood cells that have a crescent shape due to damage from thrombi in the microcirculation.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 33-year-old woman who was involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision and sustained pelvic trauma. She is hemodynamically unstable with tachycardia, hypotension, and pelvic instability. She receives blood transfusions but then develops signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) including decreased platelets, prolonged PT/PTT, and elevated D-dimer. 

The question asks about expected peripheral blood smear findings in this patient with DIC. DIC causes widespread microvascular thrombosis and consumption of clotting factors and platelets. This leads to schistocytes (fragmented erythrocytes) and consumption of red blood cells. 

Of the answer choices, choice B ""Crescent-shaped, fragmented erythrocytes"" best matches the expected peripheral blood smear findings in DIC.

"Q:A 24-year-old man presents with a history of intermittent fever for the last 2 days. He says his episodes of fever are accompanied by shaking and chills. He mentions that his father has been recently recovered from chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria, which was treated successfully with quinine. On physical examination, his temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse rate is 110/min, blood pressure is 116/80 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 18/min. Examination of his abdomen reveals splenomegaly. His blood sample is sent for the examination of the peripheral smear, which confirms the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The patient is placed on treatment with oral quinine. After 5 days, the patient returns with improved symptoms of malaria but with complaints of a headache, tinnitus, nausea, and dizziness. The patient mentions that he has been taking a drug for the last 3 months to control his dyspepsia symptoms.

This is a clinical vignette about a 24-year-old man with malaria who develops side effects after being treated with quinine. The key details are that he has P. falciparum malaria treated with quinine, and subsequently develops headache, tinnitus, nausea and dizziness. He has also been taking a dyspepsia medication for 3 months. 

The question asks which of the listed drugs is most likely causing his side effects. Since quinine is known to cause cinchonism with symptoms of headache, tinnitus, nausea and dizziness, the dyspepsia medication he has been taking is likely interacting with the quinine metabolism to cause these side effects. 

Of the choices given, cimetidine is an H2 blocker used for dyspepsia that can inhibit cytochrome P450 metabolism and lead to increased quinine levels and toxicity. The other drugs listed are less likely to interact with quinine in this manner.

This is a clinical vignette about a 24-year-old man with malaria who develops side effects after being treated with quinine. The key details are:
- 24-year-old man with intermittent fever, shaking, and chills 
- Father recently had chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria treated with quinine
- Physical exam shows splenomegaly
- Blood smear confirms P. falciparum malaria
- Placed on quinine treatment
- After 5 days, develops headache, tinnitus, nausea, dizziness
- Has been taking a dyspepsia medication for 3 months

The question asks which of the listed drugs is most likely causing the side effects in this patient. Based on the clinical vignette, the patient likely developed quinine toxicity after being treated with quinine for P. falciparum malaria. The dyspepsia medication he has been taking for 3 months is likely a histamine H2 blocker like cimetidine, which can interact with quinine and cause cinchonism with symptoms of headache, tinnitus, nausea, and dizziness.

C: Cimetidine

"Q:A previously healthy 25-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 4-day history of fever, joint and body pain, diffuse headache, and pain behind the eyes. This morning he noticed that his gums bled when he brushed his teeth. He returned from a backpacking trip to the Philippines 4 days ago. His temperature is 39.4°C (103.0°F). Physical examination shows a diffuse maculopapular rash. His leukocyte count is 3,200/mm3 and platelet count is 89,000/mm3. Further evaluation shows increased serum levels of a flavivirus. Which of the following is the most likely causal pathogen??

Based on the information provided in the question stem, this appears to be a case of a recent traveler to the Philippines presenting with fever, body aches, headache, eye pain, and bleeding gums after 4 days of symptoms. Lab findings show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and evidence of a flavivirus infection. 

The key clues here are travel to the Philippines, the physical exam findings of a maculopapular rash, the lab abnormalities, and the presence of a flavivirus. This makes dengue virus the most likely diagnosis. 

Chikungunya, Ebola, Hanta, and Lassa viruses are less likely based on the geographic exposure and clinical presentation. Dengue virus is endemic to the Philippines and commonly presents with fever, rash, headaches, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and bleeding manifestations. The other viruses have different geographic distributions and would not be expected to present in this manner.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 25-year-old man with fever, body aches, headache, eye pain, and bleeding gums after returning from a trip to the Philippines. The description of a diffuse maculopapular rash along with thrombocytopenia and leukopenia points towards a viral hemorrhagic fever. The presence of a flavivirus in the serum makes dengue virus the most likely diagnosis. Chikungunya, Ebola, Hanta, and Lassa viruses are less likely based on the clinical presentation and geographic association.

"Q:An investigator is studying the effect of a high-lipid diet on glucose metabolism in Wistar rats. The experimental rat group is fed a high-lipid diet while the control group is fed a low-lipid diet. Two month after initiation of the experiment, the rats in both groups are injected with insulin and serum glucose measurements are obtained. Compared to the control group, the high-lipid diet group has a significantly higher average serum glucose after receiving insulin. Which of the following intracellular changes is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this finding??

This is a question about the effect of a high-lipid diet on insulin resistance and glucose metabolism. The key finding is that rats fed a high-lipid diet had higher serum glucose levels after insulin injection compared to control rats on a low-lipid diet. This indicates the high-lipid diet group developed insulin resistance. 

The question asks which intracellular change is most likely involved in causing this insulin resistance. Choice A about TP53 is unrelated. Choice C about nuclear localization signal exposure is irrelevant. Choices D and E about caspase 8 and protein kinase A are also unrelated. 

Choice B about increased activity of serine kinases is the most relevant mechanism. Serine phosphorylation of IRS proteins by serine kinases is a key pathway leading to insulin resistance. The high-lipid diet likely increased serine kinase activity, causing increased IRS serine phosphorylation and interfering with normal insulin signaling and glucose uptake.

This is a question about the effect of a high-lipid diet on insulin resistance and glucose metabolism. The key finding is that rats fed a high-lipid diet had higher serum glucose levels after insulin injection compared to control rats fed a low-lipid diet. This indicates the high-lipid diet group developed insulin resistance. 

The question asks which intracellular change is most likely involved in causing this insulin resistance. Choice A about TP53 is unrelated. Choice C about nuclear localization signal exposure is irrelevant. Choice D about caspase 8 is also unrelated. 

Choice B about increased activity of serine kinases is correct. Serine phosphorylation of IRS proteins by serine kinases is a key mechanism by which high-lipid diets promote insulin resistance. Choice E about decreased protein kinase A is unrelated.

<answer>
B: Increased activity of serine kinases

This is a medical question asking about the histologic appearance of an endometrial biopsy specimen from a 43-year-old woman with heavy, irregular menstrual bleeding. The biopsy shows straight uniform tubular glands with tall pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells that have high mitotic activity in an edematous stroma. 

Based on the description, this indicates endometrial hyperplasia, which is caused by increased estrogen stimulation of the endometrium. Therefore, we need to identify which choice is responsible for increased estrogen production.

Luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulates ovulation and progesterone production by the corpus luteum. Corpus luteum produces progesterone. 5-alpha-reductase and theca externa cells are involved in androgen production. Aromatase converts androgens to estrogens, so increased aromatase activity would increase estrogen levels and cause endometrial hyperplasia.

<answer>
E: Aromatase

This is a question about the histologic appearance of an endometrial biopsy specimen from a 43-year-old woman with heavy, irregular menstrual bleeding. The key details in the stem are:
- Heavy, irregular menstrual bleeding 
- Blood and clots in the posterior fornix on pelvic exam
- Endometrial biopsy shows straight uniform tubular glands with tall pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells and high mitotic activity in an edematous stroma

This indicates endometrial hyperplasia, which is caused by increased estrogen stimulation of the endometrium. The choices list various hormones and cells involved in the menstrual cycle. To determine which one is responsible for the histologic appearance, we need to consider which hormone or cell type would cause endometrial hyperplasia.

"Q:A 35-year-old man is admitted with an acute onset of dysphagia, odynophagia, slight retrosternal chest pain, hypersalivation, and bloody sputum. These symptoms appeared 3 hours ago during a meal when the patient ate fish. The patient’s past medical history is significant for repair of a traumatic esophageal rupture 5 years ago.
The patient’s vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg, heart rate 87/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and temperature 36.8℃ (98.2℉). On exam, the patient is pale and breathing deeply. The oral cavity appears normal. The pharynx is erythematous but with no visible lesions. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiovascular examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is nondistended and nontender. Which of the following interventions are indicated in this patient??

This is a clinical vignette describing a 35-year-old man with acute onset of dysphagia, odynophagia, chest pain, hypersalivation, and bloody sputum. The symptoms started suddenly during a meal. He has a history of prior esophageal rupture repair. His vital signs show mild hypertension but are otherwise normal. On exam, he has a normal oral cavity but erythematous pharynx.

The acute onset of dysphagia and odynophagia in the setting of eating suggests an esophageal obstruction, likely due to food impaction. The chest pain, hypersalivation, and bloody sputum are concerning for possible esophageal perforation. His history of prior esophageal rupture repair puts him at higher risk for these issues. 

The options provided include IV glucagon, bougienage, Foley catheter removal, emergency endoscopy, and removal with Magill forceps. Glucagon is used for esophageal food impactions but would not address a potential perforation. Bougienage (passage of a dilator) is risky in the setting of possible perforation. Foley catheter removal is unrelated. Emergency endoscopy is the best option to directly visualize the esophagus, identify any obstruction or perforation, and perform interventions. Magill forceps could worsen a perforation.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 35-year-old man with acute onset of dysphagia, odynophagia, chest pain, hypersalivation, and bloody sputum after eating fish. His history is significant for prior repair of a traumatic esophageal rupture. His vital signs are normal except for mild hypertension. On exam, he has an erythematous pharynx but no visible lesions. 

The acute onset of dysphagia and odynophagia after eating fish suggests an esophageal obstruction. The chest pain and hypersalivation indicate possible esophageal rupture. The bloody sputum suggests bleeding. 

The choices include IV glucagon, bougienage, Foley catheter removal, emergency endoscopy, and removal with Magill forceps. 

Glucagon would not be indicated in this scenario. Bougienage is an invasive procedure that would not be appropriate in an acute setting. Foley catheter removal is unrelated to the patient's presentation. Emergency endoscopy would allow direct visualization of the esophagus and identification of the obstruction, but is invasive and carries risks. Magill forceps could be used to manually remove an obstructing object, but this is an invasive procedure with risks.

The best initial intervention would be removal of the obstructing object with endoscopy, followed by definitive treatment of the underlying cause.

"Q:A 49-year-old man presents with an 11-month history of progressive fatigue. He denies any night sweats, weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, change in bowel habits, or bleeding. He has no significant past medical history. His vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 119/81 mm Hg, pulse 83/min, and respiratory rate 19/min. On physical examination, mild splenomegaly is noted on abdominal percussion. Laboratory findings are significant for a leukocyte count of 16,700/mm3 and a low serum leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score. A bone marrow biopsy is performed, which shows marked hypercellularity with a clear dominance of granulocytes. Cytogenetic analysis is positive for the Ph1 gene. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient??

Based on the patient's symptoms of fatigue, splenomegaly, high leukocyte count, low LAP score, and bone marrow biopsy findings showing granulocyte hyperplasia, this patient most likely has chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The presence of the Ph1 gene on cytogenetics confirms the diagnosis of CML. 

The treatment options listed include:
A) Hydroxyurea - A chemotherapy drug that inhibits DNA synthesis. Used in CML to help control high white blood cell counts.
B) Interferon-α-2b - Immunotherapy drug with anti-proliferative effects. Can be used to treat early stage CML. 
C) Rituximab - Monoclonal antibody against CD20 on B cells. Used in B cell lymphomas, not indicated in CML.
D) Cytarabine - Chemotherapy drug, antimetabolite. Used in acute leukemias like AML, not first line for CML.  
E) Imatinib - Tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the BCR-ABL fusion protein. First line treatment for chronic phase CML.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 49-year-old man with a 11-month history of progressive fatigue. Key findings include splenomegaly, elevated leukocyte count, low LAP score, and bone marrow biopsy showing granulocytic predominance with Ph1 gene positivity. 

The history, physical exam, and lab findings are consistent with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The Ph1 gene positivity confirms the diagnosis. 

The question asks for the best treatment course. Choice A (hydroxyurea) is used for some types of leukemia but not CML. Choice B (interferon-α-2b) is a chemotherapy agent used for CML. Choice C (rituximab) is a monoclonal antibody used for B cell lymphomas, not CML. Choice D (cytarabine) is an antimetabolite chemotherapy agent used for acute leukemias, not CML. 

Choice E (imatinib) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the BCR-ABL fusion protein in CML. This is considered first-line therapy for chronic phase CML.

"Q:A 3-week-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents because of a 3-day history of progressive lethargy and difficulty feeding. He was born at term and did not have difficulty feeding previously. His temperature is 39.4°C (103°F), pulse is 220/min, respirations are 45/min, and blood pressure is 50/30 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on 100% oxygen shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Examination shows dry mucous membranes, delayed capillary refill time, and cool skin with poor turgor. Despite multiple attempts by the nursing staff, they are unable to establish peripheral intravenous access. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management??

This is a question about a 3-week-old infant with signs of shock, including tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, delayed capillary refill, and poor skin perfusion. The main options for vascular access are peripheral IV, central venous catheter, intraosseous, or intramuscular epinephrine. Peripheral IV access has failed, so another option is needed urgently. Intraosseous access allows rapid vascular access in infants and is the fastest and most appropriate next step in this critically ill neonate. Intramuscular epinephrine could help stabilize the blood pressure but does not provide intravenous access for fluids and medications. Internal jugular vein cannulation and intubation are more invasive and take longer compared to intraosseous access. Ultrasound guided peripheral IV may be difficult in such a small infant and is not the best option in a critically ill, hypotensive neonate.

This is a question about the appropriate next step in managing a 3-week-old infant with signs of hypovolemic shock, including lethargy, tachypnea, hypotension, and delayed capillary refill. The key points are that the infant is very young, has signs of hypovolemia, and IV access cannot be obtained. The choices include various vascular access methods for infants. Rapid sequence intubation is not indicated in this scenario. Epinephrine may help temporarily but does not provide IV access. Intramuscular epinephrine is an acceptable option. Internal jugular vein cannulation is difficult in an infant and not recommended. Intraosseous cannulation is too invasive for an initial attempt. Ultrasound-guided IV access is the best option for a young infant with unobtainable peripheral IV access.

This is a question about identifying a factor during pregnancy that could have prevented a condition in a newborn baby. Based on the description of the baby's symptoms, which include microcephaly, abnormal facial features, weak extremities, poor reflexes, and a heart murmur, the condition is likely fetal alcohol syndrome. Fetal alcohol syndrome is caused by alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Therefore, the factor that could have prevented this condition if identified and addressed early in the pregnancy is alcohol consumption by the mother.

This is a question about identifying the factor that could have prevented a condition in a newborn infant. The description of the infant's physical exam findings are consistent with fetal alcohol syndrome. Fetal alcohol syndrome is caused by alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Therefore, the factor that could have prevented this condition if identified early in the pregnancy is alcohol consumption by the mother.

"Q:An 8-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother. She is concerned that her son has had intermittent periods of severe abdominal pain over the past several days that has been associated with emesis and ""currant jelly"" stool. Of note, the family lives in a rural part of the state, requiring a 2 hour drive to the nearest hospital. He currently appears to be in significant pain and has vomited twice in the past hour. On physical examination, a sausage-shaped mass is noted on palpation of the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Ultrasound of the abdomen was consistent with a diagnosis of intussusception. An air-contrast barium enema was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis and also successfully reduced the intussusception. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient??

This is a clinical vignette about an 8-month-old boy with intussusception that was successfully reduced with an air-contrast barium enema. The key findings are that the child lives far from the hospital, had severe abdominal pain with vomiting and ""currant jelly"" stools, and a sausage-shaped mass was palpated on physical exam. Ultrasound and air-contrast enema confirmed the diagnosis of intussusception and successfully reduced it. 

The question asks for the next best step in management. Choice A is incorrect because the child should be observed for recurrence given the distance to care and severity of initial presentation. Choice B is incorrect because repeated enemas would expose the child to unnecessary radiation without clear benefit. Choice C is incorrect because lead point evaluation is not routinely needed after successful reduction. Choice D is correct because 24 hour admission for observation is recommended to monitor for recurrence, which can happen in up to 10% of cases. Choice E is incorrect because urgent surgery is not indicated after successful nonoperative reduction.

This is a clinical vignette about an 8-month-old boy with intussusception that was successfully reduced with an air-contrast barium enema. The question is asking for the next best step in management.

Choice A is incorrect because the patient was successfully reduced, so no further intervention is needed at this time. 

Choice B is incorrect because repeat enemas every 6 hours would be excessive and unnecessary. 

Choice C is incorrect because lead point evaluation is not indicated after successful reduction with enema. 

Choice D is incorrect because 24 hour observation is not required after successful reduction. 

Choice E is incorrect because urgent surgical reduction is not indicated after successful nonoperative reduction with enema.

"Q:A 79-year-old woman who lives alone is brought to the emergency department by her neighbor because of worsening confusion over the last 2 days. Due to her level of confusion, she is unable to answer questions appropriately. She has had type 2 diabetes mellitus for 29 years for which she takes metformin. Vital signs include: blood pressure 111/72 mm Hg, temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F), and pulse 100/min. Her fingerstick blood glucose is 210 mg/dL. On physical examination, she is not oriented to time or place and mistakes the nursing assistant for her cousin. Laboratory results are shown:
Hemoglobin 13 g/dL

This is a clinical vignette describing a 79-year-old woman with worsening confusion over the past 2 days. Key findings include:
- Lives alone, brought to ED by neighbor due to confusion
- Unable to answer questions appropriately due to confusion
- Longstanding type 2 diabetes (29 years) on metformin
- Fever of 38.5C, tachycardia 
- Hyperglycemia (glucose 210 mg/dL)
- Disoriented to time and place, mistaking nursing assistant for cousin
- Leukocytosis with left shift

Based on the acute onset of confusion in an elderly patient with fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis, the most likely diagnosis is delirium. The other choices can be ruled out:
- Alzheimer's dementia has insidious onset.
- Depression would not cause disorientation. 
- Brief psychotic disorder is possible but less likely than delirium given the fever and leukocytosis.
- Delusional disorder has subacute onset over weeks to months.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 79-year-old woman with worsening confusion over the past 2 days. She is unable to answer questions appropriately due to her level of confusion. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is on metformin. On exam she is not oriented to time or place and mistakes the nursing assistant for her cousin. Lab results show leukocytosis with a left shift. 

The acute onset of confusion in an elderly patient with a history of diabetes is most consistent with delirium. The lab results showing leukocytosis with left shift support this diagnosis. The other answer choices can be ruled out: Alzheimer's dementia has a more insidious onset, depression would not cause leukocytosis, brief psychotic disorder is unlikely with no psychotic symptoms, and delusional disorder does not explain the acute confusion.

"Q:A 34-year-old Ethiopian woman who recently moved to the United States presents for evaluation to a surgical outpatient clinic with painful ulceration in her right breast for the last 2 months. She is worried because the ulcer is increasing in size. On further questioning, she says that she also has a discharge from her right nipple. She had her 2nd child 4 months ago and was breastfeeding the baby until the pain started getting worse in the past few weeks, and is now unbearable. According to her health records from Africa, her physician prescribed antimicrobials multiple times with a diagnosis of mastitis, but she did not improve significantly. Her mother and aunt died of breast cancer at 60 and 58 years of age, respectively. On examination, the right breast is enlarged and firm, with thickened skin, diffuse erythema, edema, and an ulcer measuring 3 × 3 cm. White-Gray nipple discharge is present. The breast is tender with axillary and cervical adenopathy. Mammography is ordered, which shows a mass with a large area of calcifications, parenchymal distortion, and extensive soft tissue and trabecular thickening in the affected breast. The patient subsequently undergoes core-needle and full-thickness skin punch biopsies. The pathology report states a clear dermal lymphatic invasion by tumor cells. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis??

This is a clinical case scenario describing a 34-year-old woman with a painful ulceration and discharge from her right breast. She has a family history of early-onset breast cancer in her mother and aunt. Imaging shows a mass with calcifications and biopsy reveals dermal lymphatic invasion by tumor cells. 

The key findings pointing to inflammatory breast cancer are: 
- Rapid onset of breast erythema, edema, and peau d'orange appearance
- Tender, enlarged breast with diffuse skin thickening  
- Pathology showing dermal lymphatic invasion

The other options can be ruled out:
- LCIS and DCIS are non-invasive cancers without lymphatic invasion 
- Infiltrating lobular and ductal carcinomas typically lack the rapid diffuse inflammatory changes described

This is a clinical case scenario describing a 34-year-old woman with a painful ulceration and discharge from her right breast. She has a family history of early-onset breast cancer in her mother and aunt. Imaging shows a mass with calcifications and biopsy reveals dermal lymphatic invasion by tumor cells. 

The key findings pointing to inflammatory breast cancer are:
- Rapid onset of breast enlargement and skin thickening 
- Diffuse erythema and edema of the breast
- Biopsy showing dermal lymphatic invasion

The other choices can be ruled out:
- LCIS and DCIS are non-invasive cancers without lymphatic invasion
- Infiltrating lobular and ductal carcinomas typically have a more localized appearance

"Q:A 50-year-old man presents to the emergency department with chief complaints of abdominal pain, distension, and bloody diarrhea for a day. Abdominal pain was episodic in nature and limited to the left lower quadrant. It was also associated with nausea and vomiting. He also has a history of postprandial abdominal pain for several months. He had an acute myocardial infarction which was treated with thrombolytics 3 months ago. He is a chronic smoker and has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus for 10 years. On physical examination, the patient is ill-looking with a blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse 100/min, respiratory rate of 22/min, temperature of 38.0°C (100.5°F) with oxygen saturation of 98% in room air. The abdomen is tender on palpation and distended. Rectal examination demonstrates bright red color stool. Leukocyte count is 14,000/mm3. Other biochemical tests were within normal ranges. Abdominal X-ray did not detect pneumoperitoneum or air-fluid level. The recent use of antibiotics was denied by the patient and stool culture was negative for C. difficile. Contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed segmental colitis involving the distal transverse colon. What is the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms??

Based on the information provided in the question stem, the key findings are:
- 50-year-old man with abdominal pain, distension, and bloody diarrhea 
- Episodic pain limited to left lower quadrant, associated with nausea and vomiting
- History of postprandial abdominal pain for several months
- Recent myocardial infarction treated with thrombolytics 3 months ago
- Chronic smoker, diabetes mellitus for 10 years
- Vital signs showing hypotension and tachycardia  
- Abdominal tenderness and distension on exam
- Bright red blood on rectal exam
- Leukocytosis on labs
- Negative stool culture for C. difficile
- CT scan showing segmental colitis in distal transverse colon

The episodic and postprandial nature of the abdominal pain, along with the patient's cardiac history, smoking, and diabetes, raise suspicion for mesenteric ischemia. The bloody diarrhea, leukocytosis, and CT findings of segmental colitis localized to the distal transverse colon are most consistent with ischemic colitis.

Of the choices provided, embolism is the most likely cause of this presentation.

This is a clinical case scenario describing a 50-year-old man with abdominal pain, distension, bloody diarrhea, and postprandial abdominal pain. He has a history of myocardial infarction treated with thrombolytics 3 months ago. Key findings include abdominal tenderness, distension, bright red stool, leukocytosis, segmental colitis on CT scan, and negative stool culture for C. difficile. 

The differential diagnosis includes:
- Aneurysm: Unlikely given lack of bruit, pulsation, or other vascular exam findings. 
- Clostridium difficile infection: Unlikely given negative stool culture and lack of typical C. difficile symptoms like fever, watery diarrhea, and leukocytosis.
- Embolism: Unlikely given lack of risk factors and normal coagulation studies.
- Atherosclerosis: Most likely given lack of vascular exam findings and negative cardiac workup. The patient's risk factors of diabetes, smoking, and age predispose him to atherosclerosis.
- Hypokalemia: Unlikely given normal serum potassium level.

"Q:A 31-year-old man is brought in to the clinic by his sister because she is concerned about his behavior since the death of their mother 2 months ago. The patient’s sister states that he has always been a ‘loner’ and preferred being by himself than socializing with others. His social isolation resulted in him being ‘socially awkward’, as described by his family. However, 2 months ago, when he found out about the death of their mother, he showed little emotion and attended her funeral in jeans and a dirty T-shirt which upset the rest of their family. When asked about it, he shrugged and said he was in a hurry to get to the funeral and “just left the house with what I had on.” He does not speak much during the interview, allowing his sister to speak on his behalf. His sister insists that he has ‘always been like this’, quiet and a complacent child who had no interest in playing with other children. The patient currently lives alone and spends his time repairing and building electrical appliances, and his sister is worried that his self-imposed isolation is making it ‘impossible for him to interact with other people normally’.

- He showed little emotion after his mother's death and did not dress appropriately for the funeral. 
- He does not speak much during the interview and allows his sister to speak for him.  
- His sister says he has always been quiet and uninterested in interacting with others, even as a child.
- He currently lives alone and spends time on solitary hobbies like repairing appliances.  
- His sister is concerned about his inability to interact with others normally due to his isolation.

Based on the information provided in the question stem, the key features are:
- The patient is a 31-year-old man who has always been a loner and preferred being alone. He is described as quiet and socially awkward.
- He showed little emotion after his mother's death and did not dress appropriately for the funeral. 
- He does not speak much during the interview and allows his sister to speak for him. 
- His sister says he has always been quiet and uninterested in interacting with others, even as a child.
- He currently lives alone and spends time on solitary hobbies like repairing appliances.
- His sister is worried about his inability to interact with others normally due to his isolation.

This history is most consistent with schizoid personality disorder. The lack of interest in social relationships, emotional detachment, preference for solitude, and social awkwardness point towards this diagnosis. The other options can be ruled out based on details provided.

The question asks to identify the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation. The presence of a chancre in a pregnant patient raises suspicion for syphilis infection. The other choices describe later stages of syphilis that would not present with a chancre.

This is a question about congenital heart defects in a newborn. The key details in the stem are: 
- Cyanosis shortly after birth
- Ultrasound showing aorta coming off the right ventricle and anterior to pulmonary artery
- Given prostaglandin E1 and surgery planned to correct defect

This indicates the newborn likely has transposition of the great arteries (TGA). In TGA, the aorta arises from the right ventricle instead of the left, and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle instead of the right. This causes deoxygenated and oxygenated blood to mix. 

The correct answer will indicate the failure of the normal spiraling of the aorticopulmonary septum during fetal development, which leads to TGA.

"Q:A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-day history of fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and the sensation of his heartbeat roaring in the ears. He informs you that he recently had an acute upper respiratory infection. He is a retired car salesman, and he informs you that he and his partner enjoy traveling to the tropics. His medical history is significant for gout, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and multiple basal cell carcinomas on his face and neck. He currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a 6-pack of beer per day, and denies any illicit drug use. His vital signs include: temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 111/min, and respiratory rate 23/min. On physical examination, his pulses are bounding, his complexion is pale, and scleral icterus is apparent. The spleen is moderately enlarged. Oxygen saturation was initially 81% on room air, with a new oxygen requirement of 8 L by face mask. Laboratory analysis results show a hemoglobin level of 7.1 g/dL and elevated total bilirubin. Of the following options, which laboratory test can help to make the diagnosis??

This is a clinical case of a 62-year-old man presenting with fatigue, exertional dyspnea, bounding pulses, pale complexion, scleral icterus, splenomegaly, hypoxemia, anemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. 

The key findings are anemia, jaundice, splenomegaly, and recent upper respiratory infection. This clinical picture is most consistent with hemolytic anemia. The direct Coombs test can help confirm the diagnosis of hemolytic anemia by detecting antibodies bound to the patient's RBCs. 

Choice A tests for hemosiderin in urine sediment, which may indicate intravascular hemolysis but is non-specific. Choice B tests serum ferritin levels, which does not help diagnose hemolytic anemia. Choice C tests for allergies, which is unrelated. Choice D tests different hemoglobin types, which may indicate hemoglobinopathy but does not confirm immune-mediated hemolysis.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 62-year-old man with fatigue, exertional dyspnea, bounding pulses, pale complexion, scleral icterus, splenomegaly, and anemia. The key findings are anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly, which point towards a diagnosis of hemolytic anemia. 

The question asks which laboratory test can help make the diagnosis. Choice A tests for hemosiderin in urine sediment, which can indicate intravascular hemolysis but is not the best test. Choice B tests serum ferritin levels, which does not help diagnose hemolytic anemia. Choice C tests for allergies, which is unrelated. Choice D tests hemoglobin types, which can help diagnose hemoglobinopathies but does not directly diagnose hemolytic anemia. Choice E is the direct Coombs test, which detects antibodies bound to RBCs and is the best test to diagnose hemolytic anemia by detecting immune-mediated hemolysis.

Based on the description, the patient is exhibiting symptoms of mania such as decreased need for sleep, increased activity and energy, grandiose thoughts, and impulsive behavior. This suggests she may be experiencing bipolar disorder. The best initial treatment would be a mood stabilizer to help manage the manic symptoms. Valproate is a commonly used mood stabilizer. Antipsychotics like olanzapine may also help augment treatment. Antidepressants like venlafaxine could worsen mania and are not recommended. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic but is not a first line treatment. ECT is reserved for severe or treatment resistant cases.

This is a question about choosing the best initial treatment for a 35-year-old female with symptoms of mania, including decreased need for sleep, increased activity, grandiose thoughts, and impulsivity. She has a history of self-diagnosed depression 2 years ago. The question asks about the best initial treatment.

Based on the description, this patient likely has bipolar disorder. The manic symptoms described are consistent with mania. Her history of depression suggests she may have depressive episodes as well. 

The choices include anticonvulsants like valproate, mood stabilizers like olanzapine, antidepressants like venlafaxine, and antipsychotics like haloperidol. 

For bipolar disorder, mood stabilizers like valproate are first-line treatments for acute mania. Antipsychotics like olanzapine can also be used but are not preferred as monotherapy. Antidepressants like venlafaxine are not first-line. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic but is not typically used as initial monotherapy.

Therefore, the best initial treatment for this patient is valproate.

"Q:An 8-month-old boy is brought to a medical office by his mother. The mother states that the boy has been very fussy and has not been feeding recently. The mother thinks the baby has been gaining weight despite not feeding well. The boy was delivered vaginally at 39 weeks gestation without complications. On physical examination, the boy is noted to be crying in his mother’s arms. There is no evidence of cyanosis, and the cardiac examination is within normal limits. The crying intensifies when the abdomen is palpated. The abdomen is distended with tympany in the left lower quadrant. You suspect a condition caused by the failure of specialized cells to migrate. What is the most likely diagnosis??

Based on the information provided in the question stem, this is likely a case of a condition caused by the failure of specialized cells to migrate in an 8-month-old boy presenting with fussiness, poor feeding, weight gain despite poor feeding, crying when abdomen is palpated, and abdominal distension with tympany in the left lower quadrant. 

The choices provided include various gastrointestinal abnormalities. Meckel diverticulum and duodenal atresia can cause obstruction but are less likely in an 8-month-old. DiGeorge syndrome is caused by a chromosomal deletion rather than failure of cell migration. 

Pyloric stenosis and Hirschsprung disease are both caused by the failure of specialized cells to migrate properly during fetal development. Pyloric stenosis typically presents earlier, around 2-8 weeks of age, with projectile vomiting as the hallmark symptom. 

Hirschsprung disease presents later, often after the newborn period, with abdominal distension, constipation, and failure to pass meconium due to the lack of ganglion cells in the colon. This fits best with the clinical presentation in the question stem.

This is a clinical vignette describing an 8-month-old boy with symptoms of fussiness, poor feeding, weight gain despite poor feeding, crying when abdomen is palpated, and abdominal distension with tympany in the left lower quadrant. 

The key findings are abdominal distension and tympany in the left lower quadrant, which localize the problem to the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. This, along with the crying when palpating the abdomen, suggests a condition caused by the failure of specialized cells to migrate properly during fetal development. 

Of the choices given, pyloric stenosis is the most likely diagnosis. Pyloric stenosis causes hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter muscle, which can lead to gastric outlet obstruction and abdominal distension. The crying when palpating the abdomen is a classic physical exam finding in pyloric stenosis. The other choices do not explain the abdominal findings.

This is a question about treating Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). The patient has several risk factors for CDI including recent hospitalization, antibiotics (clindamycin) use, and older age. His symptoms of watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis are classic for CDI. 

The choices include oral metronidazole, intravenous vancomycin, oral fidaxomicin, oral rifaximin, and intravenous metronidazole. Based on guidelines, oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin are preferred over metronidazole for initial episodes of CDI. Rifaximin lacks activity against C. difficile and would not be appropriate. Intravenous vancomycin could be used for severe CDI, but this patient has mild-moderate disease based on the clinical description.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 42-year-old man with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and leg swelling and redness who was treated with intravenous clindamycin for an infection. He now presents with profuse watery diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramping, fever, tachycardia, and mild left lower quadrant abdominal tenderness. Lab tests show leukocytosis and elevated CRP. 

The history of recent antibiotic use with fever, abdominal symptoms, and lab findings are most consistent with Clostridium difficile infection. The most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy would be oral metronidazole to treat the C. difficile infection.

"Q:A 8-month-old girl is brought to her pediatrician because her mom is concerned that she may have a ""lazy eye"". She was born prematurely at 33 weeks and was 3 pounds at birth. Her mother also says that there is a history of visual problems that run in the family, which is why she wanted to make sure that her daughter was evaluated early. On presentation, she is found to have eyes that are misaligned both horizontally and vertically. Physical examination and labs reveal no underlying disorders, and the patient is discharged with occlusion therapy to help correct the misalignment. Which of the following would most likely have also been seen on physical exam??

This is a clinical vignette about an 8-month-old girl with misaligned eyes (strabismus) brought in by her mother due to family history of visual problems. The question asks which additional physical exam finding would likely be present.

The history of premature birth and low birth weight raises suspicion for retinopathy of prematurity as a cause. However, the vignette states physical exam and labs were unrevealing. 

The description of misaligned eyes both horizontally (esotropia or exotropia) and vertically (hypertropia or hypotropia) indicates a type of strabismus.

The choices include findings consistent with various eye disorders:
A) Asymmetric corneal light reflex could indicate strabismus/misaligned eyes
B) Bitemporal hemianopsia suggests an optic nerve or optic chiasm lesion
C) Increased intraocular pressure indicates glaucoma 
D) Fundus neovascularization suggests retinopathy or other retinal vascular disease
E) Nystagmus (involuntary eye movements) can be associated with strabismus

This is a clinical vignette about an 8-month-old girl with misaligned eyes (strabismus) that was likely present from birth given her premature birth and low birth weight. The question asks which additional finding would most likely be present on physical exam. 

Choice A describes an asymmetric corneal light reflex, which can indicate strabismus. This would be expected in the patient with strabismus. 

Choice B describes bitemporal hemianopsia, which is not typically associated with strabismus. 

Choice C describes increased intraocular pressure, which can be associated with glaucoma but is not a typical finding in strabismus. 

Choice D describes fundus neovascularization, which can be seen in some retinal diseases but is not a typical finding in strabismus. 

Choice E describes nystagmus, which is a reflex eye movement that can be seen in strabismus. This would also be expected in the patient with strabismus.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 66-year-old man with jaundice, weight loss, and abnormal liver tests concerning for obstructive jaundice due to pancreatic cancer. Imaging reveals a pancreatic head mass causing biliary obstruction that has been stented. The question is asking for the most appropriate next step in management.

Choices include radiation therapy, gastroenterostomy, pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure), chemotherapy, and central pancreatectomy. Since imaging reveals a likely pancreatic cancer causing biliary obstruction, the most appropriate next step would be surgical resection if the patient is a surgical candidate. Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) is the standard surgical treatment for resectable pancreatic head cancers.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 66-year-old man with jaundice, abdominal discomfort, fatigue, dark urine, pale stools, weight loss, hypertension, smoking history, and pancreatic head mass found on imaging. The key findings are jaundice, pancreatic head mass, and elevated liver enzymes, which are consistent with pancreatic cancer. The next step in management would be to surgically resect the pancreatic head mass, which is the source of the cancer.

This is a question about the expected results of knocking out the RAG1 and RAG2 genes in mice. RAG1 and RAG2 are involved in V(D)J recombination, which is necessary for the production of functional B and T cell receptors. Knocking out these genes should prevent V(D)J recombination and maturation of B and T cells.

Choice A about NADPH oxidase is unrelated to RAG1/2 and B/T cell development. Choice C about CD40L and Choice D about CD18 are also unrelated. Choice E is incorrect because knocking out RAG1/2 should cause an immunodeficiency phenotype.

Therefore, the expected result is choice B - a total lack of B and T cells due to inability to produce functional antigen receptors.

This is a question about the expected results of knocking out the RAG1 and RAG2 genes in mice. RAG1 and RAG2 are genes that encode proteins involved in V(D)J recombination, which is necessary for the production of functional B and T cell receptors. Knocking out these genes would prevent V(D)J recombination and maturation of B and T cells.

"Q:A 52-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of a cough and hoarseness. He reports that the cough is worse when he lies down after lunch. His temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F); the remainder of his vital signs are within normal limits. Because the physician has recently been seeing several patients with the common cold, the diagnosis of a viral upper respiratory tract infection readily comes to mind. The physician fails to consider the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease, which the patient is later found to have. Which of the following most accurately describes the cognitive bias that the physician had??

This is a question asking about cognitive biases that can affect clinical decision making. The physician in this case made a diagnosis of viral upper respiratory infection based on recently seeing other patients with colds, without considering other possibilities. This reflects the availability heuristic, where diagnoses that readily come to mind are given more weight. The confirmation bias involves seeking out evidence to support an initial hypothesis and failing to look for evidence that would disconfirm it. Anchoring refers to being influenced too heavily by an initial piece of information. Visceral biases involve being swayed by emotions. Framing bias involves making different decisions based on how information is presented. So the physician's bias here reflects the availability heuristic.

This is a question about cognitive biases. The physician in the scenario is more likely to diagnose a viral upper respiratory infection for the patients with the common cold because the physician has recently seen many patients with colds. This suggests the physician has an availability bias, where diagnoses that come readily to mind are given more weight.

This is a question about risk factors for penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The patient is a 45-year-old man with penile SCC but no history of sexual activity or STDs. The question asks which factor is associated with reduced risk of penile SCC.

Choice A about frequent intercourse is not relevant since the patient denies sexual activity. Choice B about HPV 16/18 is a risk factor for penile SCC, not a protective factor. Choice C about smoking is a known risk factor. Choice D about circumcision is a protective factor against penile SCC. Choice E about UV light for psoriasis has not been associated with penile SCC risk.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice D, circumcision, which is associated with reduced risk of penile SCC.

This is a question about penile cancer risk factors. The patient is a 45-year-old man with redness, discharge, and a biopsy showing squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) on his penis. The question asks which of the answer choices is associated with a reduced risk of penile SCC.

Choice A can be eliminated, as having frequent intercourse does not reduce penile SCC risk. 

Choice B can be eliminated, as HPV infection does not necessarily lead to penile SCC. While HPV 16 and 18 are associated with increased risk, HPV positivity alone does not reduce risk of SCC.

Choice C can be eliminated, as smoking does not reduce penile SCC risk. 

Choice D, circumcision, is associated with a reduced risk of penile SCC. Circumcised men have a lower incidence of penile cancer compared to uncircumcised men. 

Choice E can be eliminated, as UV light treatments for psoriasis do not affect penile SCC risk.

"Q:A 40-year-old man presents to the office with complaints of epigastric discomfort for the past 6 months. He adds that the discomfort is not that bothersome as it does not interfere with his daily activities. He does not have any other complaints at the moment. The past medical history is insignificant. He is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. He recently came back from a trip to South America where he visited a relative who owned a sheep farm. On physical examination, he has a poorly palpable epigastric non-tender mass with no organomegaly. The hepatitis B and C serology are negative. The liver CT scan and MRI are shown. What is the most likely diagnosis?? 
{'A': 'Liver abscess', 'B': 'Tuberculosis', 'C': 'Hepatocellular carcinoma', 'D': 'Echinococcosis', 'E': 'Hemangioma'},",Please answer with one of the option in the bracket. Write reasoning in between <analysis></analysis>. Write answer in between <answer></answer>.,"<analysis>

Based on the information provided in the question stem, the key findings are:
- 40-year-old man with epigastric discomfort for 6 months 
- Discomfort does not interfere with daily activities
- Recently visited relative's sheep farm in South America
- Physical exam showed poorly palpable epigastric non-tender mass
- Negative hepatitis B and C serology
- CT scan and MRI show cystic lesion in liver

The location of the cystic lesion in the liver along with the recent travel history to a sheep farm in South America points towards echinococcosis (hydatid cyst) as the most likely diagnosis. Echinococcosis is caused by the parasite Echinococcus granulosus which is found in dogs and sheep. Humans can become infected by ingesting eggs from contaminated food or water. This results in cyst formation in organs like the liver. The other options can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings.

Based on the information provided in the question stem, the key findings are:
- 40-year-old man with epigastric discomfort for 6 months, not interfering with daily activities
- Recent travel to South America and exposure to sheep farm
- Physical exam showed poorly palpable epigastric mass, no organomegaly
- Negative hepatitis B and C serology
- CT scan and MRI showed cystic lesion in liver

The exposure to sheep farm in South America raises suspicion for echinococcosis (hydatid cyst) given the cystic lesion in the liver. The lack of fever, weight loss, or other systemic symptoms makes infectious causes like tuberculosis less likely. The lack of palpable mass makes liver abscess less likely. Hepatocellular carcinoma is unlikely in a 40-year-old with no risk factors. Hemangioma is a possibility but echinococcosis is more likely given the exposure history.

This is a question about amyloidosis and its effects on cardiac function. Amyloidosis can cause cardiac abnormalities including cardiomyopathy and heart failure. In amyloidosis cardiomyopathy, the ejection fraction (EF) is typically preserved initially due to compensatory mechanisms. However, over time, the compliance of the ventricles (the ability to fill with blood) decreases due to stiffening of the myocardium. So the EF is preserved but the compliance is decreased.

This is a patient with signs and symptoms of Cushing's disease, including weight gain, irregular menses, hypertension, diabetes that is difficult to control, and elevated late-night salivary cortisol and morning plasma ACTH. Imaging shows a pituitary adenoma, confirming the diagnosis of Cushing's disease due to an ACTH-secreting pituitary tumor. 
The optimal treatment is surgical removal of the pituitary adenoma, which is the source of excess ACTH production driving cortisol overproduction. Choice E, transsphenoidal pituitary adenoidectomy, is therefore the best answer. Choices A, B, C, and D are incorrect as they do not treat the underlying cause of excess ACTH production from the pituitary tumor.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 47-year-old woman with weight gain, irregular menses, type 2 diabetes and hypertension that are difficult to control, elevated late-night salivary cortisol and morning plasma ACTH, and a pituitary adenoma found on MRI. 

The key findings are:
- Weight gain and irregular menses suggest Cushing's syndrome
- Elevated late-night salivary cortisol and morning plasma ACTH indicate Cushing's disease due to ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma
- MRI confirms pituitary adenoma

The optimal treatment for Cushing's disease is surgical removal of the pituitary adenoma. Radiotherapy and bilateral adrenalectomy would not treat the underlying cause. Unilateral adrenalectomy may help control cortisol levels temporarily but does not treat the ACTH-secreting adenoma. Transsphenoidal pituitary adenoidectomy is the best option to cure Cushing's disease by removing the source of ACTH production.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 62-year-old man with symptoms of headaches, fatigue, tinnitus, pruritus, and burning sensations in his extremities. He has elevated blood pressure and lab findings of high Hb and Hct. His physician prescribes him aspirin and therapeutic phlebotomy. 

The key findings are high Hb and Hct, elevated blood pressure, and symptoms suggestive of anemia and vasculitis. This clinical presentation is most consistent with polycythemia vera, a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by an overproduction of red blood cells. 

The question asks which statement about this condition is true.

This is a clinical vignette about a 78-year-old woman with decreased urinary output and malaise 9 days after being treated for a perforated gastric ulcer and sepsis. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and was recently treated with antibiotics for Pseudomonas sepsis. Lab tests show elevated BUN and creatinine consistent with acute kidney injury. The question asks which urinalysis finding is most likely associated with her condition.

Based on the clinical history, the most likely diagnosis is acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to sepsis/septic shock leading to acute kidney injury. In ATN, the renal tubular epithelial cells are damaged, leading to muddy brown granular casts in the urine. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

Choices A and D may indicate glomerular disease like glomerulonephritis, which is unrelated to her clinical presentation. Choice B may indicate liver disease. Choice E, waxy casts, are seen in chronic kidney disease, which she does not have.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 78-year-old woman who developed decreased urinary output and malaise 9 days after being treated for a perforated gastric ulcer and sepsis. She was previously treated with antibiotics for sepsis. The question asks which urinalysis finding is most likely associated with her condition.

Based on the clinical history, the patient likely has acute kidney injury secondary to sepsis. The urinalysis findings associated with acute kidney injury include:
- RBC casts: indicate glomerular bleeding/damage
- WBC casts: indicate glomerular inflammation/infection
- Muddy brown casts: indicate glomerular thrombosis/obstruction

Pigmented casts and waxy casts are not typically seen in acute kidney injury. WBC casts are most consistent with acute glomerulonephritis, which can occur as a complication of sepsis.

This is a medical question involving a patient with shortness of breath, fatigue, and dark colored urine who recently underwent aortic valve replacement surgery. The question asks about interpreting findings from a peripheral blood smear. 

Based on the clinical history, the dark urine suggests there may be hemolysis or breakdown of red blood cells occurring. The blood smear would help confirm this. 

Choice A about unconjugated bilirubin is unrelated. Choice C about low ferritin may relate to anemia but not the acute hemolysis. Choice D about low platelets may be seen with valve surgery but is unrelated to the hemolysis. 

Choice B about elevated LDH is the most indicative finding of hemolysis as LDH is released from broken down red blood cells. 

Choice E about elevated haptoglobin is incorrect because hemolysis causes haptoglobin to decrease as it binds free hemoglobin.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 58-year-old man with worsening shortness of breath, fatigue, and dark colored urine after undergoing aortic valve replacement surgery 1 month ago. The question asks about the most likely laboratory finding in this patient. 

The key findings are:
- Shortness of breath and fatigue suggest pulmonary embolism or heart failure. 
- Dark colored urine suggests hemolysis.
- Recent aortic valve replacement surgery raises suspicion for prosthetic valve associated endocarditis.

The photomicrograph shows schistocytes, which are fragmented red blood cells, consistent with hemolysis. 

Of the answer choices, low unconjugated bilirubin would be expected with hemolysis, as bilirubin is the breakdown product of hemoglobin. The other findings are not directly related to hemolysis.

<answer>
A: Low unconjugated bilirubin

"Q:A 62-year-old man seeks evaluation at an outpatient clinic for a single, red, crusty lesion on the shaft of his penis and a similar lesion on the middle finger of his left hand. He recently immigrated to the US from Africa. The lesions are painless and the physicians in his country treated him for syphilis and eczema, with no improvement. He lives with his 4th wife. He smokes 2 packs of cigarette per day and has been doing so for the last 30 years. He is not aware of any family members with malignancies or hereditary diseases. The physical examination is remarkable for an erythematous plaque, with areas of crusting, oozing, and irregular borders on the dorsal surface of the penile shaft and a similar lesion on his left middle finger (shown in the picture). The regional lymph nodes are not affected. A biopsy is obtained and the pathologic evaluation reveals cells with nuclear hyperchromasia, multinucleation, and increased mitotic figures within the follicle-bearing epithelium.

This is a patient with skin lesions on the penis and finger. Key findings include:
- 62 year old man 
- Immigrated from Africa
- Red, crusty lesions on penis and finger
- Lesions are painless
- Previously treated for syphilis and eczema without improvement
- Smokes 2 packs per day for 30 years 
- Biopsy shows nuclear hyperchromasia, multinucleation, and increased mitotic figures

Based on the biopsy results showing nuclear changes and mitotic figures, this suggests a malignant or pre-malignant condition. The location on the penis and finger point towards squamous cell carcinoma in situ or carcinoma. 

Of the choices, Bowen's disease (squamous cell carcinoma in situ) and Erythroplasia of Queyrat (squamous cell carcinoma in situ of the penis) fit the clinical and pathological findings. Bowen's disease can occur on the penis or finger. Erythroplasia of Queyrat is specific to the penis.

This is a clinical case scenario involving a 62-year-old man with penile and hand lesions. The key findings are:
- Red, crusty lesions on penis and finger
- Recent immigration from Africa
- Lesions are painless and unresponsive to previous treatments
- Smokes 2 packs per day for 30 years
- Biopsy shows nuclear hyperchromasia, multinucleation, and increased mitotic figures

Based on the location, morphology, and biopsy findings, this presentation is most consistent with squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCC-in-situ) of the penis or finger. 

Condyloma acuminata (genital warts) would not have the biopsy findings described. Bowenoid papulosis and lichen sclerosus would not be as aggressive or have the biopsy findings. Bowen's disease and erythroplasia of Queyrat are subtypes of squamous cell carcinoma that would have more malignant features on biopsy.

This is a clinical case involving a 29-year-old woman with progressive vision loss, periorbital pain, weakness, numbness and tingling in the left leg. The neurological exam shows signs of upper motor neuron disease including spasticity, hyperreflexia and Babinski reflex. The MRI shows multiple hyperintense lesions in the periventricular white matter and corpus callosum, characteristic of demyelination. 

The differential diagnosis includes acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), multiple sclerosis (MS), CADASIL, lead toxicity and ALS. However, ADEM is less likely given the subacute presentation without encephalopathy. ALS would not explain the MRI findings. CADASIL usually causes strokes and dementia in older patients. Lead toxicity could cause these MRI changes but is unlikely in this demographic without clear exposure history. 

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis given the clinical presentation and MRI findings is multiple sclerosis. MS commonly affects young adults and causes episodes of neurological deficits associated with demyelinating lesions in the CNS.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 29-year-old woman with progressive vision loss in her right eye, periorbital pain, weakness, numbness, and tingling in her left leg. She has neurological findings of gait imbalance, Babinski reflexes, spasticity, and exaggerated deep tendon reflexes. An MRI shows multiple lacunar infarcts in the periventricular white matter. 

The key findings here are the young age of onset, neurological findings of spasticity, Babinski reflexes, and lacunar infarcts on MRI, which are classic for CADASIL. The vision loss and periorbital pain point towards a vascular etiology. 

Of the choices given, CADASIL is the most likely diagnosis. The other choices do not fit with the clinical presentation.

This patient is a 31-year-old female with a history of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer treated with tamoxifen. She now presents with abnormal vaginal bleeding and an endometrial biopsy showing endometrial hyperplasia with atypia. 

Tamoxifen is known to increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Endometrial hyperplasia with atypia confers a significant risk of concurrent or future endometrial cancer. However, this patient is trying to conceive. 

Of the options, a hysterectomy would definitively treat the endometrial hyperplasia but would affect her fertility. Estrogen therapy is contraindicated given her history of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. Progestin therapy can be used to treat endometrial hyperplasia and preserve fertility. Annual endometrial biopsies would not definitively treat the endometrial hyperplasia.

This is a question about the appropriate management of a 31-year-old female with endometrial hyperplasia with atypia. The key findings are:
- 31-year-old female 
- Spotting between periods for 3 months
- History of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer treated with tamoxifen
- Endometrial biopsy shows endometrial hyperplasia with atypia
- Trying to have children

The choices include different hysterectomy options, estrogen/progestin therapy, progestin-only therapy, and observation with endometrial biopsies. 

For a 31-year-old female with endometrial hyperplasia with atypia, the next best step would be to start progestin-only therapy to treat the endometrial hyperplasia. Hysterectomy would be premature at this stage. Estrogen therapy is contraindicated due to the history of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. Observation with endometrial biopsies alone would not treat the endometrial hyperplasia.

D: Start progestin-only therapy

This is a question about acute changes in renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in a 19-year-old man who was in a motor vehicle accident and has abdominal pain and tenderness suggestive of intra-abdominal injury. The key findings are hypotension from blood loss/hypovolemia due to the trauma and abdominal injury. In this setting of decreased blood volume/pressure, the kidneys will respond by decreasing RPF and GFR to maintain fluid balance.

This is a question about the acute renal physiology changes that occur in a patient with a splenic laceration after a motor vehicle accident. The key details in the stem are the patient's history of infectious mononucleosis, vital signs showing hypotension and tachycardia, and physical exam findings of abdominal guarding, tenderness, and rebound tenderness. This suggests the patient has developed acute pancreatitis likely due to the trauma. In acute pancreatitis, there is often a concurrent splenic laceration. The acute changes in RPF and GFR in this scenario would be decreased RPF and decreased GFR as the damaged pancreas and splenic tissue lead to decreased blood flow and filtration.

C: No change in RPF and decreased GFR

This is a question about the potential complications of cocaine use during pregnancy. Cocaine is a stimulant drug that can cause harm to the fetus when used during pregnancy. The question is asking which of the listed complications is most likely to occur if the mother continues to use cocaine throughout the pregnancy.

Choice A, premature delivery, is not a direct complication of cocaine use during pregnancy. Premature delivery can occur but is not specifically linked to cocaine use. 

Choice B, obstructed labor, can occur due to uterine scar tissue from previous cesarean deliveries, not cocaine use. 

Choice C, congenital heart defect, is a potential complication of cocaine use during pregnancy. Cocaine can cross the placenta and harm the developing heart.

Choice D, neural tube defects, is not a known complication of cocaine use during pregnancy. Neural tube defects are caused by folate deficiency, which is not a direct effect of cocaine use. 

Choice E, polyhydramnios, is not a known complication of cocaine use during pregnancy. Polyhydramnios can occur with other causes like diabetes or fetal anomalies, not cocaine use.

Based on this analysis, choice C, congenital heart defect, is the most likely complication to occur if the mother continues to use cocaine during pregnancy. Cocaine can harm the developing fetal heart.

This is a clinical vignette describing an infant with bilious vomiting, inability to pass meconium, and abdominal distension since birth. The key finding is the absence of Meissner's and Auerbach's plexi on biopsy of the proximal colon. 

Meissner's plexus is located in the submucosa and Auerbach's plexus is located between the longitudinal and circular muscle layers. The absence of these neural plexi indicates aganglionosis, which is the hallmark of Hirschsprung's disease. 

Hirschsprung's disease is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses of the distal bowel, leading to functional obstruction. Bilious vomiting in a newborn suggests high intestinal obstruction, and the distended abdomen is consistent with obstruction. Inability to pass meconium is another classic sign of Hirschsprung's in a newborn.

The other choices do not fit with the clinical vignette or explain the key biopsy finding of absent neural plexi. Therefore, Hirschsprung's disease is the most likely diagnosis.

This is a clinical vignette describing a newborn infant with bilious vomiting, inability to pass meconium, and abdominal distension. The key finding is the absence of Meissner's and Auerbach's plexi on biopsy of the proximal colon. 

Meissner's and Auerbach's plexi are submucosal and myenteric plexuses, respectively, that are present in the proximal bowel. Their absence leads to functional obstruction due to impaired peristalsis. 

Hirschsprung's disease is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses of the distal bowel, not the proximal. Ileocecal intussusception, Meckel's diverticulum, juvenile polyposis syndrome, and sigmoid volvulus are all possible but less likely based on the information provided.

Based on the patient's presentation of altered consciousness, confabulation, widespread rash, corkscrew body hair, petechiae, and hyperkeratotic papules, the most likely diagnosis is vitamin C deficiency (scurvy). The rash and corkscrew hairs are characteristic of scurvy. Vitamin C is required for collagen synthesis, and deficiency leads to weakened blood vessel walls, causing the petechiae and bruising. The likely cause in this homeless patient with alcoholism is poor nutrition. 

Vitamin C is required for the hydroxylation of proline residues in collagen. Therefore, impairment of proline hydroxylation is most likely causing the hyperkeratotic skin rash in this patient.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 56-year-old homeless man with altered consciousness, confabulation, rash, and other findings concerning for alcohol abuse and possible Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. The question asks about the most likely impaired process that is causing his hyperkeratotic rash. 

Based on the history and physical exam findings, the most likely diagnosis is Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Thiamine is needed for the hydroxylation of proline residues in collagen synthesis. Impaired thiamine metabolism leads to corkscrew body hair, peripheral neuropathy, and hyperkeratotic rashes. 

Of the answer choices, ""Hydroxylation of proline residues"" is the process most directly related to thiamine metabolism and deficiency. The other choices do not relate to thiamine or its metabolic pathways.

"Q:A 22-year-old primigravid woman at 41 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. Pregnancy has been uncomplicated. She has asthma treated with theophylline and inhaled corticosteroids. She has had 2 surgeries in the past to repair multiple lower limb and pelvis fractures that were the result of a car accident. She is otherwise healthy. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F) and blood pressure is 108/70 mm Hg. Examination shows the cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated; the vertex is at -4 station, with the occiput in the anterior position. Uterine activity is measured at 275 MVUs. Maternal pushing occurs during the contractions. Fetal heart tracing is 166/min and reactive with no decelerations. Epidural anesthesia is initiated for pain relief. After 4 hours of pushing, the vertex is found to be at -4 station, with increasing strength and rate of uterine contractions; fetal heart tracing shows late decelerations.

This is a question about a prolonged labor in a primigravid woman at 41 weeks gestation. The key details in the stem are that she has been pushing for 4 hours with strong contractions, but the fetal head remains at -4 station with late decelerations. 

The choices include inefficient pushing (A), epidural anesthesia (B), insufficient contractions (C), cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) (D), and deep transverse arrest (E). 

Epidural anesthesia (B) can prolong the second stage of labor but would not prevent descent on its own with adequate pushing. Contractions are noted to be strong (275 MVUs) so insufficient contractions (C) is incorrect. Inefficient pushing (A) may play a role but would not prevent descent with strong contractions over 4 hours. 

The lack of descent of the fetal head despite strong contractions and pushing indicates a mechanical obstruction, which points to CPD (D) as the most likely cause. Deep transverse arrest (E) would cause the head to be stuck in the midpelvis rather than at -4 station.

This is a question about prolonged labor in a primigravid woman at 41 weeks gestation. The key findings are:
- 41 weeks gestation 
- Active labor 
- History of multiple lower limb and pelvis fractures requiring surgery
- Otherwise healthy
- Normal vital signs and physical exam except for prolonged pushing
- Vertex at -4 station, increasing contractions, late decelerations after 4 hours of pushing
- Epidural anesthesia initiated

The choices include inefficient pushing, epidural anesthesia, insufficient contractions, cephalopelvic disproportion, and deep transverse arrest. 

The prolonged pushing and lack of progress despite pushing suggests inefficient pushing as a possible cause. The epidural anesthesia could also contribute to the prolonged pushing phase. However, the vertex at -4 station and late decelerations indicate a cephalopelvic disproportion, which is the most likely cause given the patient's history of multiple pelvic fractures.

D: Cephalopelvic disproportion

"Q:A 47-year-old male presents to the emergency department with facial swelling and trouble breathing. These symptoms began this morning and progressively worsened over the past several hours. Vital signs are as follows: T 37.7, HR 108, BP 120/76, RR 20, and SpO2 96%. Physical examination reveals nonpitting swelling of the face, hands, and arms as well as edema of the tongue and mucus membranes of the mouth and pharynx. The patient reports several episodes of mild facial swelling that occurred during childhood between the ages of 5-18, but he does not recall seeing a physician or receiving treatment for this. His medical history is otherwise negative, except for mild hypertension for which his primary care physician initiated lisinopril 2 weeks ago.

This is a patient with a history of recurrent episodes of facial swelling that began in childhood, now presenting with acute facial swelling, edema of the tongue and oral mucosa, and trouble breathing. The key findings are recurrent angioedema without urticaria beginning in childhood, which narrows the differential diagnosis. 

Choice A, MHC class I deficiency, would not present with these findings. MHC class I deficiency causes recurrent viral infections.

Choice B, defective lysosomal storage proteins, also does not match this presentation. Lysosomal storage diseases cause developmental delay and neurologic symptoms. 

Choice C, lack of NADPH oxidase, causes chronic granulomatous disease, which presents with recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, not angioedema.

Choice D, defect in cytoskeletal glycoprotein, is associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which causes joint hypermobility and skin findings. 

Choice E, deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor, is the most likely diagnosis. C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency causes hereditary angioedema, which presents with recurrent angioedema without urticaria beginning in childhood or adolescence. The lack of C1 inhibitor allows unchecked activation of the complement cascade.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 47-year-old male with acute onset facial swelling, trouble breathing, and angioedema. The history of recurrent angioedema during childhood suggests an inherited angioedema disorder. The lack of treatment for the childhood episodes also points to an inherited disorder. The recent initiation of lisinopril for mild hypertension is likely causing an angioedema flare due to ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema. 

The choices describe various inherited disorders. MHC class I deficiency causes recurrent viral infections but not angioedema. Defective lysosomal storage proteins, lack of NADPH oxidase, and cytoskeletal glycoprotein defects do not cause angioedema. C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency is the most common cause of hereditary angioedema and fits the clinical presentation.

"Q:A 68-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a routine checkup. He currently has no complaints. During routine blood work, he is found to have a slightly elevated calcium (10.4 mg/dL) and some findings of plasma cells in his peripheral blood smear (less than 10%). His physician orders a serum protein electrophoresis which demonstrates a slight increase in gamma protein that is found to be light chain predominate. What is the most likely complication for this patient as this disease progresses if left untreated??

This is a clinical vignette describing a 68-year-old man with mildly elevated calcium, plasma cells in his blood, and increased light chain gamma proteins on serum electrophoresis. This presentation is most consistent with monoclonal gammopathy or multiple myeloma. The key finding is the light chain predominance, which indicates a plasma cell dyscrasia. As multiple myeloma progresses, it can cause end-organ damage. The most common complication is kidney dysfunction from light chain cast nephropathy.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 68-year-old man with mildly elevated calcium, plasma cells in his blood, and light chain predominance on serum protein electrophoresis. This presentation is most consistent with a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), which is characterized by the presence of an abnormal plasma cell population and/or abnormal monoclonal protein without evidence of end-organ damage. 

The question asks about the most likely complication if this disease progresses if left untreated. The choices include peripheral neuropathy, kidney damage, Raynaud's phenomenon, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly. 

Of these choices, kidney damage is the most common and concerning complication of MGUS as it can progress to the more severe disease multiple myeloma. The other choices are not known complications of MGUS.

"Q:A 33-year-old man comes to the physician because of right scrotal swelling for the past 2 weeks. He has had mild lower abdominal discomfort for the past 3 weeks. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. He appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows gynecomastia. There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy. There is a firm nontender nodule over the right testicle. When a light is held behind the scrotum, it does not shine through. When the patient is asked to cough, the nodule does not cause a bulge. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Digital rectal examination is unremarkable. Serum alpha-fetoprotein, LDH, and hCG levels are markedly elevated. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. Ultrasound of the testis shows a cystic 3-cm mass with variable echogenicity. A CT of the abdomen shows multiple hypoattenuating lesions on the liver and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. A radical inguinal orchiectomy with retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is performed.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 33-year-old man with right scrotal swelling, lower abdominal discomfort, and physical exam findings consistent with a testicular mass and metastatic disease. The key findings are an elevated AFP, LDH, and hCG, a testicular mass on ultrasound, and metastases on CT. This clinical presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of metastatic testicular cancer, likely a nonseminomatous germ cell tumor. 

The correct management after radical orchiectomy and lymph node dissection would be chemotherapy with a platinum-based regimen like cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (choice B). This is the standard first-line chemotherapy for metastatic testicular cancer. Radiation therapy, leucovorin/5-FU/oxaliplatin, and active surveillance would not be appropriate initial treatments. Stem cell transplant may be considered later if needed but is not the next step.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 33-year-old man with right scrotal swelling and lower abdominal discomfort for 2 and 3 weeks respectively. Key findings include gynecomastia, firm nontender nodule over the testicle, elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein, LDH and hCG levels, and hypoattenuating liver and lymph node lesions on CT. 

The differential diagnosis includes testicular tumor, germ cell tumor, and metastatic disease. The ultrasound finding of a cystic mass with variable echogenicity supports a germ cell tumor. The elevated tumor markers and CT findings are consistent with metastatic disease. 

The next step in management would be to determine the primary tumor site and stage. Radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and stem cell transplant are not indicated as initial therapy. Active surveillance would not be appropriate given the metastatic disease.

This is a question about the mechanism of action of sofosbuvir, an antiviral drug used to treat hepatitis C infection. The patient has cirrhosis and hepatitis C infection with a high viral load. The question asks about the mechanism of action of sofosbuvir.

To answer this, we need to know the mechanism of action of sofosbuvir. The choices list different mechanisms of action for various antiviral drugs. Based on my medical knowledge, sofosbuvir is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor, meaning it prevents hepatitis C virus from replicating by inhibiting its RNA polymerase.

This is a question about cyanotic congenital heart disease in a newborn infant. The stem describes physical exam and echocardiogram findings consistent with tetralogy of Fallot. The choices list various factors that may correlate with the presence or absence of cyanosis. Choice A is correct because the degree of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction affects the amount of deoxygenated blood shunting right-to-left through the ventricular septal defect, which determines whether the infant will be cyanotic. Choice B is irrelevant. Choice C is incorrect because the size of the VSD does not necessarily correlate with cyanosis. Choice D is unrelated to cyanosis. Choice E is incorrect because total hemoglobin concentration alone does not determine cyanosis.

This is a question about cyanosis in a newborn with congenital heart disease. The key findings in the stem are a systolic ejection murmur, single S2, and echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary stenosis, overriding aorta, VSD, and RVH. 

The presence or absence of cyanosis in a newborn with congenital heart disease is primarily determined by the degree of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. More severe obstruction leads to right-to-left shunting and cyanosis. The other findings of pulmonary stenosis, VSD, and RVH do not directly correlate with cyanosis.

"Q:A 40-year-old man presents with acute abdominal pain. Past medical history is significant for hepatitis C, complicated by multiple recent visits with associated ascites. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate is 115/min, blood pressure is 88/48 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 16/min. On physical examination, the patient is alert and in moderate discomfort. Cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. Abdominal examination reveals distant bowel sounds on auscultation. There is also mild diffuse abdominal tenderness to palpation with guarding present. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. A paracentesis is performed. Laboratory results are significant for the following:
Leukocyte count 11,630/µL (with 94% neutrophils)
Platelets 24,000/µL
Hematocrit 29%
Ascitic fluid analysis:
Cell count  658 PMNs/µL
 Total protein 1.2 g/dL
 Glucose 24 mg/dL
Gram stain  Gram-negative rods
Culture Culture yields growth of E. coli

This is a patient with acute abdominal pain and signs of sepsis (fever, tachycardia, hypotension). The history of hepatitis C with ascites raises concern for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The paracentesis results confirm this diagnosis, with a high neutrophil count, low glucose, and growth of E. coli from the fluid. 

The next best step is to start antibiotic therapy to treat the infection. Choice C, intravenous cefotaxime, provides appropriate broad-spectrum coverage for gram-negative rods like E. coli. Choices A, B, D, and E may be indicated later in the management but are not the immediate next step.

This is a patient with acute abdominal pain and signs of sepsis (fever, tachycardia, hypotension). The history of hepatitis C with ascites raises suspicion for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The lab results confirm the diagnosis of SBP with a high neutrophil count, low glucose, and growth of E. coli from the ascitic fluid. 

The next best step is to start empiric antibiotic therapy to cover common SBP pathogens like E. coli. IV fluids are important to improve perfusion and prevent further fluid shifts. Surgical consultation may be needed if the patient deteriorates, but antibiotics should be started first. Lipase and CT abdomen are not indicated at this point.

This is a comparison question between prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA replication. The key fact is that the entire E. coli genome (4 million base pairs) replicates in 30 minutes, while the larger mammalian genome (3 billion base pairs) replicates in 3 hours. 

The answer should explain why eukaryotic replication takes proportionally longer than prokaryotic replication, despite having much more DNA to replicate. Choice C about multiple origins of replication in eukaryotes is a key difference that allows more simultaneous replication. Choice D about DNA compaction into chromatin may also slow replication. Choices A, B, and E do not directly explain the timing difference.

This is a question comparing DNA replication in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The key finding is that the entire E. coli genome (4 million base pairs) replicates in 30 minutes, while the larger mammalian genome (3 billion base pairs) replicates in 3 hours. 

The answer choices discuss different characteristics of eukaryotic DNA replication that could explain the slower replication time for the larger genome. Choice A about telomerase is incorrect, as telomerase is not involved in eukaryotic DNA replication. Choice B about replication checkpoints is also incorrect, as checkpoints do not directly explain the replication time difference. 

Choice C about multiple origins of replication in eukaryotes is correct. Eukaryotic DNA replication occurs at multiple origins of replication along the chromosome, allowing simultaneous replication. This contrasts with prokaryotes where replication occurs at a single origin. Choice D about DNA compaction into chromatin is also correct, as chromatin structure compacts the DNA and slows replication. Choice E about more efficient DNA polymerase activity is incorrect, as the replication machinery in eukaryotes is less efficient than in prokaryotes.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 63-year-old man with urinary symptoms and an enlarged prostate on exam. He has elevated PSA levels. Finasteride is a medication used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The question asks about the most likely effect of finasteride.

Choice A describes decreased internal urethral sphincter tone, which would allow urine to flow more easily. This is a desirable effect of finasteride in BPH. 

Choice B describes increased prostatic apoptosis, which is not a known effect of finasteride. 

Choice C describes decreased urine production, which is not a known effect of finasteride. 

Choice D describes increased penile blood flow, which is not a known effect of finasteride. 

Choice E describes decreased bladder contractions, which would prevent urine storage and allow spontaneous voiding. This is not a known effect of finasteride.

Therefore, the most likely effect of finasteride in this patient is choice A, decreased internal urethral sphincter tone. This would allow urine to flow more easily and improve urinary symptoms.

"Q:A 58-year-old man is diagnosed with right lower lobe pneumonia and has been admitted to a tertiary care hospital. His laboratory investigations suggest that he acquired an infection from the hospital where he underwent an elective abdominal surgery 3 weeks ago. His past medical records reveal a history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism one year prior. After a steady clinical improvement over 5 days of inpatient treatment, he develops a cough, breathlessness, and hemoptysis on the 6th day. His temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), the pulse is 112/min, the blood pressure is 130/84 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 28/min. A general examination shows the presence of edema over the right leg and tenderness over the right calf region.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 58-year-old man with a history of hospital-acquired pneumonia after recent abdominal surgery. He also has a prior history of DVT and PE. On day 6 of treatment, he develops worsening respiratory symptoms and signs of a new DVT. The question asks about the next best diagnostic test.

Based on the acute worsening of his respiratory status and prior DVT/PE history, pulmonary embolism should be high on the differential. Edema and tenderness of the right calf raise suspicion for a new DVT. D-dimer, BNP, echocardiography are not first-line tests for suspected PE. CECT chest would be the investigation of choice to evaluate for pulmonary embolism.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 58-year-old man with a history of hospital-acquired pneumonia after recent abdominal surgery. He also has a prior history of DVT and PE. On day 6 of treatment, he develops worsening respiratory symptoms and signs of a new DVT. The question asks about the next best diagnostic test.

Based on the acute worsening of his respiratory status and prior DVT/PE history, pulmonary embolism should be high on the differential. Edema and tenderness of the right calf raise suspicion for a new DVT. D-dimer, BNP, echocardiography are not first-line tests for suspected PE. CECT chest would be the investigation of choice to evaluate for pulmonary embolism.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 58-year-old man with a history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism who develops a new episode of respiratory symptoms and signs of a deep vein thrombosis in his right leg. The question asks for the next best diagnostic test to evaluate for a pulmonary embolism.

Choice A, plasma D-dimer, is a non-specific marker for pulmonary embolism and can be falsely elevated in many conditions. 

Choice B, serum brain natriuretic peptide, is a marker of heart failure and would not be useful here.

Choice C, echocardiography, can evaluate for a pulmonary embolism but is not the immediate next step.

Choice D, contrast-enhanced CT of chest, is the best initial test to evaluate for a pulmonary embolism. It can quickly identify pulmonary embolism and differentiate it from other causes of respiratory symptoms.

Choice E, ventilation-perfusion scanning, is an older test that is not preferred over CT.

This is a clinical vignette about a 71-year-old man with asthma and dementia who is intubated for respiratory distress. The question asks about prophylactic treatment to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia in intubated patients. 

Based on the stem, this patient likely has a lower respiratory tract infection causing his asthma exacerbation. He also has dementia which led to medication noncompliance. He required intubation for respiratory failure with hypercapnia (pH 7.20). 

The choices include medications for stress ulcer prophylaxis (ranitidine, sucralfate, omeprazole) and antibiotics (clarithromycin, ceftazidime). The correct answer should be a medication shown to reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

This is a clinical vignette about a 71-year-old man with asthma and dementia who presents with acute respiratory distress and is intubated for mechanical ventilation. The question asks about prophylactic treatment to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia in this patient. 

The key points from the vignette are:
- 71-year-old man with asthma and dementia 
- Presented with acute respiratory distress and intubated for mechanical ventilation
- Has a history of non-adherence to medications, including bronchodilators
- Develops acute asthma exacerbation requiring intubation

The question asks about prophylactic treatment to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia. This refers to measures to reduce the risk of developing pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients. 

Choice A, ranitidine, is an H2 blocker used for gastroesophageal reflux disease. It would not prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Choice B, sucralfate, is a mucosal protectant used for gastrointestinal ulcers. It would not prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Choice C, clarithromycin, is an antibiotic used to treat infections. It would not prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Choice D, ceftazidime, is an antibiotic used to treat infections. It would not prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Choice E, omeprazole, is a proton pump inhibitor used for gastroesophageal reflux disease. It can help prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia by reducing acid exposure and inflammation in the lungs.

"Q:A 34-year-old man presents to the emergency department with leg weakness that significantly impairs and slows down his walking ability. He has noticed that he has been getting progressively weaker over the past 3 months. He has also experienced spontaneous twitching in his arms and thighs that is becoming more frequent. On physical examination, the patient appears to have decreased muscle tone and moderate atrophy of his arm and thigh muscles. Significant thenar atrophy is noted bilaterally, and deep tendon reflexes are increased. His lower limbs have resistance to movement and feel rigid. Pupillary light and accommodation reflexes are both normal. The patient can maintain his balance upon closing his eyes. Considering this case presentation, which of the following is the likely site of the lesion?? 
{'A': 'Nucleus of Onuf', 'B': 'Medullary lateral fasciculus', 'C': 'Ventral horn', 'D': 'Ventral posterolateral nucleus of thalamus', 'E': 'Fasciculus gracilis'},",Please answer with one of the option in the bracket.

Based on the description of progressive leg weakness and muscle atrophy in the arms and thighs, along with increased deep tendon reflexes and rigidity in the lower limbs, this clinical presentation is most consistent with an upper motor neuron disease like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The spontaneous twitching suggests lower motor neuron involvement as well. The lesion is likely affecting the motor neurons originating in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, which contain lower motor neuron cell bodies that project to skeletal muscle.

This is a clinical vignette describing a patient with progressive muscle weakness and twitching in the arms and legs over the past 3 months. The key findings are decreased muscle tone, atrophy, increased deep tendon reflexes, and rigidity in the lower limbs. This presentation is most consistent with upper motor neuron disease, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The question asks about the likely site of the lesion. In ALS, the upper motor neurons in the motor cortex and lower motor neurons in the spinal cord are affected, leading to the clinical findings described. The nucleus of Onuf in the spinal cord is the likely site of the lesion in ALS.

"Q:A 52-year-old African-American woman presents to the office complaining of difficulty swallowing for 1 week, and described it as ""food getting stuck in her throat"". Her discomfort is mainly for solid foods, and she does not have any problem with liquids. She further adds that she has frequent heartburn and lost 5 pounds in the last month because of this discomfort. She sometimes takes antacids to relieve her heartburn. Her past medical history is insignificant. She is an occasional drinker and smokes a half pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, her skin is shiny and taut especially around her lips and fingertips. A barium swallow study is ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?? 
{'A': ""Zenker's diverticulum"", 'B': 'Achalasia', 'C': 'Scleroderma', 'D': 'Polyomyositis', 'E': 'Diffuse esophageal spasm'},",Please answer with one of the option in the bracket. Write reasoning in between <analysis></analysis>. Write answer in between <answer></answer>.,"<analysis>

Based on the information provided in the question stem, the key findings are:
- 52-year-old African-American woman 
- Difficulty swallowing solids for 1 week, described as ""food getting stuck in her throat""
- Frequent heartburn, lost 5 pounds in the past month
- Occasional drinker, smokes half a pack per day
- Shiny, taut skin around lips and fingertips
- Barium swallow study ordered

The difficulty swallowing solids, weight loss, heartburn, and shiny/tight skin around the lips and fingertips point towards a diagnosis of scleroderma. Scleroderma can cause fibrosis and dysfunction of the esophagus leading to dysphagia, GERD, and weight loss. The skin changes described are also classic for scleroderma. 

The other options can be ruled out: Zenker's diverticulum would not cause skin changes. Achalasia presents with dysphagia to both solids and liquids. Polymyositis may cause dysphagia but not the skin changes described. Diffuse esophageal spasm would be unlikely with no issue swallowing liquids.

Based on the information provided in the question stem, the key findings are:
- 52-year-old African-American woman with 1 week history of difficulty swallowing solids (dysphagia)
- Associated symptoms of heartburn and weight loss 
- Occasional alcohol use and smoking
- Physical exam shows shiny skin around lips and fingertips
- Ordered barium swallow study

The dysphagia along with heartburn and weight loss suggests an upper GI motility disorder. The physical exam finding of shiny skin around the lips and fingertips points towards scleroderma as a likely diagnosis. Scleroderma can present with esophageal involvement leading to dysphagia. The barium swallow study will help confirm this diagnosis.

Of the choices provided, scleroderma is the most likely diagnosis. The other choices do not fit with the clinical presentation.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 45-year-old man with intermittent episodes of severe headaches, palpitations, profuse sweating, and pallor. The vitals given indicate hypertension, tachycardia, and hypoxemia. The symptoms and vitals are consistent with a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, which is characterized by episodic release of catecholamines like norepinephrine from a tumor of the adrenal medulla. 

The question asks for the first medication to treat this condition. Phenoxybenzamine, an alpha blocker, is the correct choice as it blocks the alpha-adrenergic effects of catecholamines released by the tumor. Phentolamine is also an alpha blocker but is shorter acting. Pilocarpine is a cholinergic agonist used for dry eyes/mouth. Prazosin is an alpha blocker but is not first-line. Propranolol, a beta blocker, would be contraindicated as an initial treatment since blocking beta receptors alone can lead to unopposed alpha stimulation and hypertensive crisis.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 45-year-old man with intermittent episodes of severe headaches, palpitations, profuse sweating, and pallor. The key findings are episodic symptoms suggestive of autonomic instability, including diaphoresis, pallor, and hypertension. This presentation is most consistent with pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal medulla that secretes excess catecholamines like epinephrine and norepinephrine. 

The question asks for the first medication to treat this condition. Phenoxybenzamine is an alpha blocker that would be used to treat an alpha-adrenergic mediated presentation like pheochromocytoma. Phentolamine is a competitive alpha blocker that could also be used. Pilocarpine is a cholinergic agonist used for dry eyes/mouth. Prazosin is an alpha blocker but would not be first-line. Propranolol is a beta blocker that would be used to treat a beta-adrenergic mediated presentation like hypertension.

This is a question about cranial nerve anatomy and function. The patient has symptoms of facial droop and difficulty closing her eyes and chewing, which indicates a lesion in the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII). 

The physician is testing the motor function of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) by having the patient open her jaw against resistance. The lateral pterygoid muscle helps open the jaw, so this would be the muscle activated during this movement.

Choices A and B (lateral pterygoid and masseter) are jaw opening/closing muscles innervated by the trigeminal nerve. Choices C, D and E (orbicularis oris, hyoglossus and buccinator) are muscles innervated by different cranial nerves (VII, XII and VII respectively) and are not involved in jaw opening.

This is a clinical vignette describing a patient with acute onset of facial droop and difficulty with eye closure and chewing. The question asks which muscle is most likely activated when the patient is asked to open her jaw against resistance. 

Based on the symptoms of facial droop and difficulty with eye closure and chewing, this patient likely has a stroke affecting the facial nerve. The facial nerve innervates many muscles of facial expression, including the orbicularis oris (circles the mouth) and buccinator (depresses the cheeks). 

To open the jaw against resistance, the masseter (chewing muscle) is activated. The orbicularis oris and buccinator are also involved in opening the mouth, but the masseter is the primary muscle activated for forceful mouth opening.

This is a question about calculating the clearance of glucose, sodium, and creatinine from the given serum and urine concentrations. The key information is the serum and urine concentrations of glucose, sodium, and creatinine along with the urine flow rate. To calculate the clearance, we need to know the urinary excretion rate of the substance. The urinary excretion rate is calculated as the urinary concentration multiplied by the urine flow rate.

<answer>
C: Glucose: 0 mg/dL, Sodium: 48 mL/min, Creatinine: 100 mg/dL

"Q:A 62-year-old man presents to the ED complaining of severe eye pain that started a few hours ago. The patient reports that he fell asleep while watching TV on the couch and woke up with right-sided eye pain and blurry vision. His wife drove him to the emergency room. His wife reports that since they arrived the patient has also been complaining of intense nausea. The patient denies fever, headache, or visual floaters. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type II diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis. He takes aspirin, lisinopril, metformin, atorvastatin, and over-the-counter ibuprofen. His temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 135/82 mmHg, and pulse is 78/min. On physical examination, the right eye is firm with an injected conjunctiva and a mildly cloudy cornea. The pupil is dilated at 6 mm and is non-reactive to light. Ocular eye movements are intact. Vision is 20/200 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye. The left eye exam is unremarkable.

This appears to be a case of acute angle closure glaucoma in the right eye. The key findings are a dilated, fixed pupil, injected conjunctiva, cloudy cornea, severe eye pain, nausea, and vision loss in the affected eye. 

Choice A, intravenous acetazolamide, is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that decreases aqueous humor production and therefore decreases intraocular pressure. This is the most appropriate initial treatment for an acute angle closure glaucoma attack to urgently lower intraocular pressure.

Choice B, iridotomy, is a laser procedure that creates an opening in the iris to improve aqueous outflow. This is not an initial treatment. 

Choice C, retinal photocoagulation, is laser treatment for retinal conditions like diabetic retinopathy. This is unrelated to the acute glaucoma attack.

Choice D, topical epinephrine, can decrease aqueous production but is not as effective as systemic acetazolamide for urgently lowering intraocular pressure in an attack. 

Choice E, topical prednisolone, is a steroid that reduces inflammation but does not address the underlying mechanism or urgently lower intraocular pressure.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 62-year-old man with acute onset of severe right eye pain, blurry vision, and nausea. The key findings on exam are a dilated, non-reactive right pupil, injected conjunctiva, and cloudy cornea. This presentation is most consistent with acute angle closure glaucoma in the right eye. 

The choices provided are different medical treatments. Choice A, intravenous acetazolamide, is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that decreases aqueous humor production and is used to treat acute angle closure glaucoma. Choice B, iridotomy, is a laser procedure to create an opening in the iris to improve aqueous outflow. Choice C, retinal photocoagulation, treats retinal conditions like diabetic retinopathy. Choice D, topical epinephrine, is used to dilate pupils but does not treat the underlying glaucoma. Choice E, topical prednisolone, is a steroid that may help with inflammation but does not treat the glaucoma.

Based on the acute presentation and exam findings, intravenous acetazolamide is the most appropriate initial treatment to lower intraocular pressure and relieve the acute angle closure glaucoma.

"Q:A day after percutaneous coronary intervention for stable angina, a 63-year-old woman develops severe pain in her right small toe. She has no history of a similar episode. She has had diabetes mellitus for 16 years. After the procedure, her blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, the pulse is 65/min, the respiratory rate is 15/min, and the temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F). Physical examination of the femoral artery access site shows no abnormalities. Distal pulses are palpable and symmetric. A photograph of the toe is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?? 
{'A': 'Atheroembolism', 'B': 'Burger’s syndrome', 'C': 'Cellulitis', 'D': 'Diabetic foot', 'E': 'Reynaud’s phenomenon'},",Please answer with one of the option in the bracket. Write reasoning in between <analysis></analysis>. Write answer in between <answer></answer>.,"<analysis>

This is a clinical vignette describing a 63-year-old woman with diabetes who develops severe pain in her right small toe the day after undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for stable angina. The key findings are:
- Severe pain in right small toe, no prior history of similar episodes
- Longstanding diabetes mellitus (16 years) 
- Recent percutaneous coronary intervention for stable angina
- Normal vital signs except slightly elevated blood pressure 
- Normal femoral access site exam, palpable distal pulses  
- Photograph shows red/purplish discoloration of right small toe

The differential diagnosis includes atheroembolism, diabetic foot ulcer/infection, cellulitis and vasculitis (e.g. Raynaud's phenomenon). Atheroembolism is the most likely given the temporal relationship with the recent cardiac catheterization procedure, presence of longstanding diabetes, and clinical photo showing ischemic changes specific to the small toe. Diabetic foot ulcer would likely have additional findings. Cellulitis and Raynaud's less likely given distribution focused only on the small toe.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 63-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus who develops severe pain in her right small toe the day after undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for stable angina. The key findings are:
- Severe pain in right small toe, no prior history of similar episodes
- Longstanding diabetes mellitus (16 years)
- Vital signs are normal except for mild hypertension 
- Physical exam of femoral access site is normal
- Distal pulses are palpable and symmetric
- Photograph shows erythema and tenderness of the right small toe

Based on the acute onset of severe pain in a small toe in a patient with longstanding diabetes, the most likely diagnosis is diabetic foot ulcer/infection. Atheroembolism, Burger's syndrome, cellulitis, and Raynaud's phenomenon are less likely given the clinical presentation.

"Q:A 47-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband with the complaints of severe abdominal pain and discomfort. The pain began 2 days earlier, she describes it as radiating to her back and is associated with nausea. Her past medical history is significant for similar episodes of pain after fatty meals that resolved on its own. She drinks socially and has a 15 pack-year smoking history. Her pulse is 121/min, blood pressure is 121/71 mm Hg, and her temperature is 103.1°F (39.5°C). She has tenderness in the right upper quadrant and epigastrium with guarding and rebound tenderness.

This is a patient presenting with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fever, nausea and vomiting. Key findings on exam include right upper quadrant and epigastric tenderness, guarding and rebound tenderness. Lab tests show elevated inflammatory markers like WBC count, neutrophil percentage and CRP. 
The most likely diagnosis is acute cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder). Imaging of the gallbladder with ultrasound would be the next best step to confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications like gallstones, empyema, perforation etc. Choices A and B are not useful in evaluating suspected cholecystitis. Choice D, upper GI endoscopy, may be helpful later if evaluating for peptic ulcer disease but is not the immediate next step. Choice E, serum lipase, would be indicated if pancreatitis was suspected, but the location and nature of pain make cholecystitis more likely.

This is a clinical case scenario describing a 47-year-old woman with severe abdominal pain, nausea, fever, and physical exam findings consistent with acute cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder). The key findings are right upper quadrant and epigastric tenderness, guarding, rebound tenderness, hypoactive bowel sounds, elevated WBC count with neutrophilia, and elevated inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP). 

The differential diagnosis includes acute cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis, mesenteric ischemia, and other intra-abdominal infections. However, the acute onset of symptoms in a patient with a history of similar episodes after fatty meals suggests this is likely acute cholecystitis. 

The next best step in management would be to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for complications. Ultrasound of the gallbladder would be the best initial test to evaluate for cholecystitis. An abdominal X-ray may show gallstones but does not evaluate the gallbladder directly. Upper GI endoscopy and serum lipase levels would not be appropriate next steps.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 44-year-old woman with recurrent UTIs who presents with sudden onset severe headache, neck stiffness, and inability to fully extend her knee. Lumbar puncture shows yellow colored fluid without leukocytes. 

The key findings are:
- Recurrent UTIs suggest possible renal artery disease or hypertension as a predisposing factor.
- Sudden severe headache with neck stiffness and inability to extend knee suggests subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
- Lumbar puncture shows xanthochromic fluid without leukocytes indicates subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Of the choices given, cerebral atrophy and saccular aneurysm are the most likely predisposing factors for subarachnoid hemorrhage in this patient. Arterial atherosclerosis, bacterial infection, and hypercoagulable state are less likely.

"Q:An 87-year-old male presents to his neurologist for a follow-up visit. He is being followed for an inoperable tumor near his skull. He reports that he recently noticed that food has started to lose its taste. He also notes increasing difficulty with swallowing. He has a history of myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and presbycusis. He takes aspirin, metoprolol, metformin, glyburide, atorvastatin, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. On examination, the patient is a frail-appearing male sitting in a wheelchair. He is oriented to person, place, and time. Gag reflex is absent on the right side. A taste evaluation is performed which demonstrates a decreased ability to detect sour and bitter substances on the right posterior tongue. The nerve responsible for this patient’s loss of taste sensation also has which of the following functions?? 
{'A': 'Parasympathetic innervation to the parotid gland', 'B': 'Parasympathetic innervation to the submandibular gland', 'C': 'Parasympathetic innervation to the trachea', 'D': 'Somatic sensory innervation to the lower lip', 'E': 'Somatic sensory innervation to the roof of the pharynx'},",Please answer with one of the option in the bracket.

This is a clinical vignette about an 87-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions who is being followed for an inoperable tumor near his skull. He is experiencing new symptoms of loss of taste sensation and difficulty swallowing. On exam he has an absent gag reflex on the right side and decreased ability to detect sour and bitter tastes on the right posterior tongue. 

Based on the clinical presentation, the most likely affected nerve is the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX). This nerve provides general sensory innervation to the posterior 1/3 of the tongue, soft palate, pharynx, and tonsils. It also provides parasympathetic innervation to the parotid gland. Loss of taste sensation on the posterior 1/3 of the tongue indicates the sensory branch of CN IX is affected. Difficulty swallowing and absent gag reflex on the right side also localize the lesion to CN IX.

The answer choices list various functions of cranial nerves in the head and neck region. Choices A, B, C relate to parasympathetic innervation of glands and trachea supplied by different nerves. Choices D and E relate to sensory innervation of areas supplied by the trigeminal and vagus nerves respectively. Only choice A matches a function of the glossopharyngeal nerve that is affected in this patient based on the clinical findings.

This is a clinical vignette describing an 87-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions who is being followed for an inoperable tumor near his skull. He is experiencing new symptoms of loss of taste sensation and difficulty swallowing. On exam, he has an absent gag reflex on the right side and decreased ability to detect sour and bitter tastes on the right posterior tongue. 

Based on the location of the tumor near his skull, the symptoms of loss of taste sensation and difficulty swallowing localized to the right side, and the absent gag reflex on the right side, this is most consistent with a lesion affecting the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX). 

The question asks which of the answer choices describes a function of this nerve. The glossopharyngeal nerve has both sensory and motor functions. On the posterior 1/3 of the tongue, it provides general sensory innervation and motor innervation to the stylopharyngeus muscle which elevates the pharynx. It also provides parasympathetic innervation to the parotid gland.

Of the answer choices, choice A describes parasympathetic innervation to the parotid gland, which is a function of the glossopharyngeal nerve. The other choices describe functions of other cranial nerves.

A: Parasympathetic innervation to the parotid gland

This is a multiple choice question about a patient with type 1 diabetes presenting with symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The key finding in the question is the fruity breath odor, along with hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis. 

The fruity breath odor is caused by the production of acetone, which is one of the ketone bodies produced in DKA from the breakdown of fatty acids. Acetone is volatile and can be detected in the breath. 

So the correct answer should be the choice that reflects excessive fatty acid breakdown leading to ketone production.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 30-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes presenting with altered mental status, tachycardia, tachypnea, dry mucous membranes, fruity breath odor, delayed tendon reflexes, and laboratory findings consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). 

The question asks which abnormality accounts for her sweet smelling breath. The fruity breath odor is a classic sign of DKA due to the production of acetone, a ketone body, from the breakdown of fatty acids in the absence of insulin-mediated glucose uptake. 

Choice A of diminished glucose metabolism is incorrect because this patient has hyperglycemia, not diminished glucose metabolism. 

Choice B of excessive fatty acid mobilization is a feature of DKA, so this is likely the correct answer.

Choice C of extrahepatic ketone production is incorrect because ketones are primarily produced in the liver from glucose breakdown. 

Choice D of fermentation of excess blood sugars is incorrect because this patient has DKA, which is caused by ketogenesis from fatty acid breakdown, not fermentation. 

Choice E of inhibition of HMG-CoA synthase is incorrect because this enzyme is inhibited in DKA due to lack of insulin, not inhibited.

Her mother is also frustrated because she feels like her daughter is acting out more and “hanging out with some no-good friends.” Upon questioning the patient with her mother in the room, the patient does not say much and makes no eye contact. The mother is asked to leave the room and the patient is questioned again about any stressors. After rapport is established, the patient breaks down and tearfully admits to trying various drugs in order to “fit in with her friends.” She says that she knows the drugs “are not good for me” but has been very stressed out about telling her friends she’s not interested. Detailed questioning reveals that the patient has been using alcohol, cocaine, and marijuana 2-3 times per week.

This is a question about the ethical and legal considerations when dealing with an adolescent patient who is using illegal drugs. The key factors to consider are:

- The patient is a minor (16 years old) so there are limitations on confidentiality. The provider has an ethical duty to involve parents/guardians in the minor's healthcare decisions. 

- However, the provider also has an ethical duty to build trust and rapport with the adolescent patient. Breaking confidentiality could damage this trust.

- The illegal drug use poses health risks that the parent/guardian should be aware of. Disclosing to the mother is ethically appropriate for the safety of the patient.  

- Legally, the provider is not required to inform authorities about illegal drug use in a minor if the goal is medical treatment rather than law enforcement. 

The answer should balance the ethical duties to respect adolescent confidentiality and involve parents, while prioritizing the health/safety of the patient.

- The patient is a minor (16 years old) so there are limitations on confidentiality. The provider has an ethical duty to involve parents/guardians in the minor's healthcare decisions. 

- However, the provider also has an ethical duty to build trust and rapport with the adolescent patient. Breaking confidentiality could damage this trust.

- The illegal drug use poses health risks that the parent/guardian should be aware of. Disclosing to the mother is ethically appropriate for the safety of the patient.  

- Legally, the provider is not required to inform authorities about illegal drug use in a minor if the goal is medical treatment rather than law enforcement. 

The answer should balance the ethical duties to respect adolescent confidentiality and involve parents, while prioritizing the health/safety of the patient.

 Please answer with one of the option in the bracket. Write reasoning in between <analysis></analysis>. Write answer in between <answer></answer>. here are the inputs Q:A 16-year-old female is brought to the primary care clinic by her mother. The mother is concerned about her daughter’s grades, which have been recently slipping. Per the mother, the patient usually earns a mix of As and Bs in her classes, but this past semester she has been getting Cs and a few Ds. Her mother is also frustrated because she feels like her daughter is acting out more and “hanging out with some no-good friends.” Upon questioning the patient with her mother in the room, the patient does not say much and makes no eye contact. The mother is asked to leave the room and the patient is questioned again about any stressors. After rapport is established, the patient breaks down and tearfully admits to trying various drugs in order to “fit in with her friends.” She says that she knows the drugs “are not good for me” but has been very stressed out about telling her friends she’s not interested. Detailed questioning reveals that the patient has been using alcohol, cocaine, and marijuana 2-3 times per week. The patient becomes agitated at the end of the interview and pleads for you to not tell her mother. She says that she knows they’re illegal but is very afraid of what her parents would say. What is the best action in response to the adolescent’s request?? 
{'A': 'Apologize and say that you must inform her mother because the use of these drugs is illegal', 'B': 'Apologize and say that you must inform legal authorities because the use of these drugs is illegal', 'C': 'Apologize and say that you must inform her mother because these drugs pose a danger to her health', 'D': 'Agree to the patient’s request and do not inform the patient’s mother', 'E': 'Reassure the patient that there is confidentiality in this situation but encourage her to tell her mother'}, <end_of_turn>

This is a question about the ethical and legal considerations when dealing with an adolescent patient who is using illegal drugs. The key factors to consider are:

- The patient is a minor (16 years old) so there are legal limitations on confidentiality. However, the physician has an ethical duty to protect the patient's privacy and confidentiality to the extent possible.

- The patient is using illegal drugs, which poses health risks. The physician has an ethical duty to inform the patient's parents about the illegal drug use, especially since the patient is afraid of what her parents would say. 

- The physician must balance the ethical duty to protect confidentiality with the ethical duty to inform parents about illegal drug use that poses health risks.

- The choices present different levels of confidentiality and parental notification. The best option should balance these ethical duties.

This is a clinical vignette describing a newborn with cyanosis and physical exam findings consistent with Down syndrome, including a heart murmur. The description of a large heart shadow on X-ray and loud S2 suggests a ventricular septal defect. The medication given would be a prostaglandin to maintain ductal patency until the defect can be surgically repaired. Prostaglandins cause vasodilation, so the answer is E.

This is a question about identifying a virus based on its properties. The key details are:
- The virus loses infectivity when its lipid membrane is disrupted by a detergent. This suggests it has an envelope made of lipid membrane.
- Its genetic material is resistant to DNase, meaning it is not DNA-based. 
- Its genetic material injected into cells produces new viral particles. This means it is able to replicate inside host cells.
Based on these clues, we can narrow down the choices to enveloped RNA viruses that can replicate in human cells.

This is a question about identifying a virus based on its properties. The key properties are:
- The virus loses infectivity when its lipid membrane is disrupted, indicating it has a lipid envelope.
- Its genetic material is resistant to DNase, meaning it is not DNA. 
- The genetic material can infect human cells and produce new viral particles.

This is a clinical vignette about a 64-year-old man with osteoarthritis of the knee who presents with foot weakness and inability to invert his foot or curl his toes. The stem asks which area is most likely to have decreased sensation on further evaluation. The swelling in the popliteal fossa and weakness with foot inversion indicate likely injury to the tibial nerve. The tibial nerve innervates the plantar surface of the foot, so decreased sensation would most likely be found on the sole of the foot.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 64-year-old man with osteoarthritis of the knee who presents with foot weakness and inability to invert his foot or curl his toes. The key findings are swelling in the popliteal fossa, weakness when attempting to invert the foot, and inability to curl the toes. This indicates a likely nerve compression or entrapment causing the foot weakness. The choices list different anatomical locations on the foot. To identify the most likely sensory loss, we need to consider which nerve is most likely being compressed or entrapped based on the clinical findings. The popliteal fossa is located behind the knee and contains the femoral and popliteal nerves. The femoral nerve innervates the medial thigh and lower leg, while the popliteal nerve innervates the posterior leg and foot. Therefore, the sensory loss is most likely to be found over the medial plantar arch or the sole of the foot, which are areas innervated by the popliteal nerve.

D: Medial plantar arch

"Q:A 29-year-old man presents to the primary care clinic in June for post-discharge follow-up. The patient was recently admitted to the hospital after a motor vehicle collision. At that time he arrived at the emergency department unconscious, hypotensive, and tachycardic.

Prior to the accident, he was up-to-date on all of his vaccinations. Which of the following vaccinations should be administered at this time?? 
{'A': '13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine', 'B': 'Inactivated (intramuscular) influenza vaccine', 'C': 'Live attenuated (intranasal) influenza vaccine', 'D': 'Measles-mumps-rubella vaccine', 'E': 'Tetanus booster vaccine'},",Please answer with one of the option in the bracket.

This is a question about which vaccine to administer to a 29-year-old man who recently underwent a splenectomy after a motor vehicle accident. The key points are:
- 29-year-old male 
- Recently underwent splenectomy after motor vehicle accident
- Was previously up-to-date on vaccinations
- Looking for recommendation on which vaccine to give at this time post-splenectomy
The main consideration is that he is now asplenic after the splenectomy. Patients without a spleen are at increased risk for certain infections, especially encapsulated bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae. Therefore, a pneumococcal vaccine is likely indicated. The other answer choices are routine vaccines but not specifically indicated after splenectomy.

This is a question about which vaccine to administer to a 29-year-old man who recently underwent a splenectomy after a motor vehicle accident. The key points are:
- 29-year-old male 
- Recently underwent splenectomy after motor vehicle accident
- Was previously up-to-date on vaccinations
- Looking for recommendation on which vaccine to give at this time post-splenectomy
The main considerations are:
- He is now asplenic after the splenectomy, so he is at increased risk of certain infections. 
- He is otherwise healthy and up-to-date on vaccines.
- The main vaccine recommendations for asplenic patients are pneumococcal and influenza.

This is a patient with symptoms of fatigue, constipation, weight gain, and dry skin. The key findings are fatigue, constipation, weight gain, and dry skin. This presentation is most consistent with hypothyroidism. The TSH level of 8.0 μU/mL confirms this diagnosis. The next best step would be to start treatment with levothyroxine, a synthetic form of the thyroid hormone thyroxine that is used to treat hypothyroidism. Erythropoietin is used to treat anemia, inhaled fluticasone/salmeterol is used for asthma, packed RBCs are used for anemia, and prednisone is used for inflammation.

"Q:A 7-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because she has been increasingly reluctant to speak at school over the past 4 months. Her teachers complain that she does not answer their questions and it is affecting her academic performance. She was born at 35 weeks' gestation and pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia. Previous well-child examinations have been normal. Her older brother was diagnosed with a learning disability 4 years ago. She is at 65th percentile for height and weight. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. She follows commands. She avoids answering questions directly and whispers her answers to her mother instead who then mediates between the doctor and her daughter. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis??

This is a clinical vignette about a 7-year-old girl who has become increasingly reluctant to speak at school over the past 4 months. The key findings are that she avoids answering questions directly at school and whispers her answers to her mother instead. She was born prematurely at 35 weeks and her brother has a learning disability. Otherwise her history and exam are normal. 

The differential diagnosis includes autism spectrum disorder, social anxiety disorder, selective mutism, and other communication disorders. However, her normal development until 4 months ago makes autism less likely. Social anxiety could cause reluctance to speak, but selective mutism better explains her specific inability to speak at school contrasted with her ability to whisper to her mother. Rett syndrome would not have such an acute presentation.

D: Selective mutism

This is a clinical vignette describing a 7-year-old girl who is reluctant to speak at school but able to communicate with her mother. The key findings are:
- Reluctance to speak at school for 4 months 
- Affects academic performance
- Born at 35 weeks gestation, preeclampsia
- Older brother has a learning disability
- Normal growth and development otherwise
- Avoids answering questions directly, whispers answers to mother
- Follows commands, able to communicate

Based on the history and physical exam findings, this presentation is most consistent with selective mutism. The differential diagnosis includes autism spectrum disorder, social anxiety disorder, and other communication disorders, but selective mutism fits the clinical picture best.

"Q:A 42-year-old woman comes to the physician because of episodic abdominal pain and fullness for 1 month. She works as an assistant at an animal shelter and helps to feed and bathe the animals. Physical examination shows hepatomegaly. Abdominal ultrasound shows a 4-cm calcified cyst with several daughter cysts in the liver. She undergoes CT-guided percutaneous aspiration under general anesthesia. Several minutes into the procedure, one liver cyst spills, and the patient's oxygen saturation decreases from 95% to 64%. Her pulse is 136/min, and blood pressure is 86/58 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism of this patient's condition??

This is a clinical vignette describing a 42-year-old woman with episodic abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and a calcified cyst with daughter cysts in her liver. During a CT-guided aspiration procedure, the cyst ruptured leading to desaturation and hypotension. 

Based on the description of a calcified cyst with daughter cysts in the liver, this is most likely a case of cystic echinococcosis caused by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. Cystic echinococcosis leads to the development of hydatid cysts in organs such as the liver, which can rupture and lead to anaphylactic reactions. 

Choices A, B, and C can be ruled out as they do not cause cysts in the liver. Choice D, Clonorchis sinensis, can lead to liver abscesses but not calcified cysts with daughter cysts.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 42-year-old woman with episodic abdominal pain and fullness, hepatomegaly, and a calcified cyst with daughter cysts in her liver. During a CT-guided aspiration procedure, the cyst ruptured leading to desaturation and hypotension. 

The key findings are:
- Calcified cyst with daughter cysts in liver - suggests cystic echinococcosis
- Rupture of cyst during aspiration - suggests hydatid disease
- Episodic abdominal pain and fullness - suggests cystic mass
- Hepatomegaly - suggests liver involvement

Of the answer choices, Echinococcus granulosus causes cystic echinococcosis, which is characterized by the development of hydatid cysts in organs like the liver. This fits with the clinical vignette.

The other answer choices do not match the clinical presentation. Strongyloides stercoralis causes intestinal infection, Trichinella spiralis causes muscle and organ cysts, Schistosoma mansoni causes liver abscesses, and Clonorchis sinensis causes liver abscesses.

This is a question about calculating power in hypothesis testing. The power of a study is defined as the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. 

To calculate power, we need to know the significance level (alpha) and the probability of type 2 error. The significance level is given as 10%. The probability of type 2 error is given as 15%. 

Power = 1 - probability of type 2 error = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

"Q:A 28-year-old woman presents with severe vertigo. She also reports multiple episodes of vomiting and difficulty walking. The vertigo is continuous, not related to the position, and not associated with tinnitus or hearing disturbances. She has a past history of acute vision loss in her right eye that resolved spontaneously several years ago. She also experienced left-sided body numbness 3 years ago that also resolved rapidly. She only recently purchased health insurance and could not fully evaluate the cause of her previous symptoms at the time they presented. The patient is afebrile and her vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, she is alert and oriented. An ophthalmic exam reveals horizontal strabismus. There is no facial asymmetry and her tongue is central on the protrusion. Gag and cough reflexes are intact. Muscle strength is 5/5 bilaterally. She has difficulty maintaining her balance while walking and is unable to perform repetitive alternating movements with her hands.

This is a clinical case scenario describing a 28-year-old woman with severe vertigo, vomiting, difficulty walking, and a history of acute vision loss and left-sided numbness years ago that spontaneously resolved. The key findings on exam are horizontal strabismus, difficulty with balance and coordination. 

Based on the acute onset of vertigo, vomiting, and difficulty walking, along with the neurological findings, this presentation is most consistent with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). ADEM is an immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system characterized by acute onset of multifocal neurological deficits including ataxia, vertigo, vision changes and motor and sensory deficits. The patient's history of prior episodes of acute neurological deficits that spontaneously resolved also supports this diagnosis.

The treatment of choice for ADEM is high-dose intravenous corticosteroids to decrease inflammation and suppress the immune response. Plasma exchange is another option, but corticosteroids are first-line. The other answer choices of acyclovir, azathioprine and high-dose glucose would not be appropriate treatments.

In summary, this patient's presentation is most consistent with ADEM given the acute neurological deficits on exam and history of similar prior episodes. High-dose corticosteroids would be the best treatment choice.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 28-year-old woman with severe vertigo, vomiting, difficulty walking, and a history of acute vision loss and left-sided numbness. The key findings are horizontal strabismus, difficulty maintaining balance and performing repetitive movements. This presentation is most consistent with multiple sclerosis, which can cause neurological deficits including vertigo, ataxia, and muscle weakness. 

The question asks for the best treatment. Acyclovir treats herpes infections, azathioprine is used for autoimmune diseases, high glucose does not treat MS, high corticosteroids can worsen MS, and plasma exchange removes autoantibodies in MS. Therefore, plasma exchange is the best treatment option for this patient with suspected MS.

This is a medical question asking about the most likely kidney biopsy finding in a 22-year-old male patient with a 2-week history of cough, decreased urination, coughing up blood-tinged sputum, no fevers/chills/weight loss, 5 year 1 pack/day smoking history, tachycardia, hypertension, dried blood around lips, elevated creatinine, and negative ANCA. 

The key findings are the acute onset of hematuria and renal insufficiency in a young smoker, which are concerning for a proliferative glomerulonephritis such as crescentic glomerulonephritis. The differential would include anti-GBM disease, ANCA-associated vasculitis, and immune-complex mediated glomerulonephritis. However, the negative ANCA makes anti-GBM disease most likely. In anti-GBM disease, antibody deposition leads to necrosis and crescent formation.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 22-year-old male with a 2-week history of cough, decreased urination, and hemoptysis. He has a 5 year smoking history. On exam he has tachycardia, hypertension, and dried blood around the lips. Lab tests show elevated creatinine and a negative ANCA. 

The key findings here are the hemoptysis, elevated creatinine, and negative ANCA, which point towards a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. The biopsy would be expected to show findings consistent with pulmonary embolism, such as fibrin deposition and thrombosis in the pulmonary vasculature.

This is a question about identifying the likely vitamin deficiency in a middle aged man found unconscious after drinking alcohol. The key details are that he was drinking alcohol, became confused and agitated after initial improvement, and had horizontal nystagmus. These symptoms point to a deficiency in vitamin B1, also known as thiamine. Thiamine deficiency is common in alcoholics and can lead to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which presents with confusion, ataxia, and eye movement abnormalities like nystagmus.

This is a clinical vignette describing a middle aged man found unconscious after drinking alcohol. He is able to open his eyes and obey commands, indicating he is not in a coma. After initial stabilization with IV fluids, he becomes confused and agitated with nystagmus, indicating a likely vitamin deficiency. 

The history of alcohol use raises suspicion for vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency, which can occur with chronic alcoholism. Thiamine deficiency causes Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which presents with confusion, ataxia, and eye movement abnormalities like nystagmus. 

Vitamin B12 deficiency is less likely in this scenario as it would cause megaloblastic anemia and neurological symptoms later in the disease process. The other vitamin deficiencies listed are less likely based on the acute presentation described.

"Q:A 27-year-old woman who recently emigrated from Brazil comes to the physician because of fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, and mild abdominal discomfort. She has not seen a physician in several years and her immunization status is unknown. She drinks 2 alcoholic beverages on the weekends and does not use illicit drugs. She is sexually active with several male partners and uses condoms inconsistently. Her temperature is 38°C (99.8°F). Physical examination shows right upper quadrant tenderness and scleral icterus. Serology confirms acute infection with a virus that has partially double-stranded, circular DNA. Which of the following is most likely involved in the replication cycle of this virus?? 
{'A': 'Bacterial translation of viral DNA', 'B': 'Cleavage of gp160 to form envelope glycoprotein', 'C': 'Transcription of viral DNA to RNA in the cytoplasm', 'D': 'Reverse transcription of viral RNA to DNA', 'E': 'Adhesion of virus to host ICAM-1 receptor'},",Please answer with one of the option in the bracket.

This is a medical question asking about the replication cycle of a virus that has partially double-stranded, circular DNA. The key details in the question stem are:
- 27-year-old woman from Brazil with fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, mild abdominal discomfort 
- Unknown immunization status
- Sexually active with multiple partners, inconsistent condom use
- Physical exam shows jaundice and right upper quadrant tenderness  
- Serology confirms acute viral infection with partially double-stranded, circular DNA

Based on the partially double-stranded, circular DNA, this likely refers to the hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV replicates through an RNA intermediate and uses reverse transcription to generate viral genomic DNA. 

So the answer should be related to reverse transcription of the viral genome.

<answer>
D: Reverse transcription of viral RNA to DNA

This is a medical question asking about the replication cycle of a virus that has partially double-stranded, circular DNA. Based on the description, this is likely a hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. HBV has partially double-stranded, circular DNA as its genome. The question asks which of the choices is most likely involved in the replication cycle of this virus.

Choice A can be eliminated because bacterial translation of viral DNA would not be relevant for HBV replication. 

Choice B describes the cleavage of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp160, which is not directly involved in HBV replication. 

Choice C describes transcription of the viral DNA into RNA, which is the first step in HBV replication. This is a key step in the viral replication cycle.

Choice D describes reverse transcription of the viral RNA into DNA, which is not the typical replication cycle for HBV. 

Choice E describes the interaction between HBV and the host cell receptor ICAM-1, which is important for viral entry but not a key step in replication.

This is a question about progressive sensorineural hearing loss in an older adult. The key finding in the stem is that the patient has worse hearing in noisy environments and more difficulty understanding women's voices, which points to high frequency hearing loss. The Rinne test showing air conduction greater than bone conduction indicates sensorineural (inner ear) pathology rather than conductive pathology. 

The choices list different structures of the ear. Sensorineural hearing loss localized to high frequencies is most consistent with damage to the basal turn of the cochlea, where high frequency sounds are transduced. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

This is a question about progressive sensorineural hearing loss in an older adult. The key finding in the stem is that the patient has worse hearing in noisy environments and more difficulty understanding women's voices, which indicates high frequency hearing loss. The Rinne test showing air conduction greater than bone conduction indicates sensorineural (inner ear) hearing loss, not conductive hearing loss. 

The choices list different structures of the ear. Sensorineural hearing loss localized to high frequencies indicates damage closest to the base of the cochlea, where high frequency sounds are transduced.

This is a question about genetic causes of cognitive impairment and brain atrophy, particularly affecting the medial temporal lobes and hippocampi. The description of impaired short-term memory with relatively intact long-term memory points towards a diagnosis of early Alzheimer's disease. The imaging findings of medial temporal lobe/hippocampal atrophy also support this diagnosis. 

The key genetic causes of early-onset Alzheimer's disease involve mutations in one of three genes: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), or presenilin 2 (PSEN2). Mutations in these genes lead to abnormal aggregation of amyloid beta in the brain, which is believed to drive the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's. 

Of the answer choices provided, a mutation in the presenilin 1 gene is most likely to be found in genetic testing of a patient with early-onset Alzheimer's disease presenting with the provided history and examination findings.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 46-year-old woman with cognitive impairment and memory deficits, as well as MRI findings of generalized atrophy in the medial temporal lobes and hippocampi. The question asks which genetic alteration is most likely to be found in this patient if her condition has a genetic etiology. 

Based on the clinical presentation of progressive memory loss and cognitive decline, as well as the MRI findings of medial temporal lobe atrophy, this patient most likely has Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease has a strong genetic component, with mutations in genes encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1, and presenilin 2 being the most common causes. 

Of the answer choices, mutation in presenilin 1 is most consistent with Alzheimer's disease. The other answer choices do not have a clear genetic association with Alzheimer's disease.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 26-year-old female with fever, cough, hemoptysis, skin lesions, and joint pain that started after an earthquake near her hometown. The key findings are hemoptysis, skin lesions, and negative bacterial cultures, along with the lung biopsy showing granulomas. This presentation is most consistent with coccidioidomycosis, an infection caused by the fungus Coccidioides. Coccidioides lives in soil and the clues that point to this diagnosis are the onset after an earthquake, which can aerosolize the fungal spores from soil, the lung granulomas on biopsy, and the systemic symptoms like rash and arthritis.

This is a clinical vignette describing a patient with fever, cough, hemoptysis, skin lesions, and joint pain after an earthquake. The description of lung biopsy results shows granulomas, which are characteristic of certain fungal infections. 

The key clues are the patient's exposure to dust and sand after the earthquake, along with the granulomatous lung findings on biopsy. This suggests an infectious etiology rather than bacteria. 

The answer choices list different environmental locations. Based on the clinical presentation and biopsy results, the most likely pathogen is a fungus found in desert dust and sand.

This is a medical question asking about contraindications for restarting oral contraceptive pills in a woman with a recent pregnancy. The key aspects to analyze are the patient's history of gestational diabetes (hemoglobin A1c of 8.6%), smoking, migraines, cervical dysplasia, and breastfeeding. Oral contraceptives are contraindicated in women over 35 who smoke due to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Migraines with aura are a contraindication, but migraines without aura are not. Cervical dysplasia and breastfeeding are not contraindications. Therefore, the patient's smoking history is the correct contraindication.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 35-year-old woman with skin discoloration and scaling on her hands. The symptoms started about 6 months ago, coinciding with a stressful life event of moving into a new house and taking care of a household. She is experiencing anxiety and obsessive thoughts about washing her hands excessively. 

The question asks which statement about her most likely diagnosis is correct. Based on the description, this patient most likely has obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The key features are the presence of obsessions (irrational thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors) that are time-consuming and cause distress. 

Choice A is correct because OCD symptoms are ego-dystonic, meaning the patient views their obsessions and compulsions as foreign to their own wishes. Choice B is incorrect because insight into the nature of their illness is often lacking in OCD. Choice C is incorrect because OCD is typically treatment-resistant. Choice D is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest early onset dementia. Choice E is incorrect because OCD can significantly impair daily functioning.

Her immediate post-operative period is unremarkable and she is discharged from the hospital on post-operative day 4. Her past medical history is also notable for major depressive disorder, obesity, and gout. She takes sertraline, allopurinol, and insulin. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. To decrease the risk of transplant rejection, her nephrologist adds a medication known to serve as a precursor to 6-mercaptopurine.

This is a question about potential side effects of a medication given to prevent transplant rejection in a kidney transplant recipient. The medication is a precursor to 6-mercaptopurine, which is an immunosuppressive medication. The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes, depression, obesity and gout. 

The question asks which toxicity the patient should be monitored for after starting this new medication. Since it is an immunosuppressive medication, we need to consider side effects related to lowered immune function. Hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis and hirsutism are not known side effects. Cytokine storm is a severe immune reaction, which is less likely with immunosuppression. Pancytopenia refers to low levels of all blood cell types and is a known side effect of immunosuppressive medications that suppress the bone marrow.

This is a question about potential side effects of a medication given to prevent transplant rejection in a kidney transplant recipient. The medication is a precursor to 6-mercaptopurine, which is an immunosuppressive medication. The question asks which toxicity the patient should be monitored for after starting this medication.

To answer this, we need to consider the potential side effects of 6-mercaptopurine and immunosuppressive medications in general. The choices include hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, hirsutism, cytokine storm, and pancytopenia. 

Cytokine storm is a severe, life-threatening reaction that can occur with certain immunosuppressive medications. Pancytopenia refers to low levels of all blood cell types. The other choices are not known side effects of 6-mercaptopurine or immunosuppressive medications in general.

This is a clinical case of hyponatremia (low sodium level) in an elderly man with a history of seizures. The key findings are progressive confusion, low serum sodium, low serum osmolality, and elevated ADH. The normal physical exam and chest X-ray make volume depletion or congestive heart failure less likely. The elevated ADH in the setting of low serum osmolality indicates inappropriate ADH secretion or SIADH as the most likely cause of the hyponatremia. Insulin deficiency, aldosterone deficiency, and excess cortisol would not explain the elevated ADH. Medications are a possibility but inappropriate ADH secretion/SIADH is the most likely based on the information provided.

This is a clinical case of hyponatremia (low sodium level) in an elderly man with a history of seizures. The key findings are low serum sodium, low serum osmolality, and elevated ADH level. This indicates the patient has syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) leading to dilutional hyponatremia. The low serum osmolality and elevated ADH level confirm this diagnosis. The other answer choices can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation.

This is a question about estimating gestational age in a pregnant patient. The key information is that this is the patient's first prenatal visit, she is 6 weeks from her last menstrual period, and her periods are irregular at baseline. 

To date a pregnancy accurately, we need a measurement that reflects fetal size and growth. Biparietal diameter, femur length, abdominal circumference, and crown-rump length all reflect fetal size. Serum beta-hCG reflects placental function rather than fetal size.

Of the fetal size measurements, crown-rump length is most accurate in early pregnancy. The other measurements become more useful later in pregnancy as the fetus grows.

This is a question about estimating gestational age in a pregnant patient. The key information in the stem is that this is the patient's first prenatal visit, she had her last menstrual period 2 months ago, and her pregnancy test was 6 weeks ago. 

To date a pregnancy accurately, we need to know the gestational age. The choices given are different fetal measurements that can be used for dating. Biparietal diameter, femur length, abdominal circumference, and crown-rump length are measurements of the fetus itself. Serum beta-hCG is a pregnancy hormone that levels off after the first 10 weeks. 

Of the fetal measurements, crown-rump length is the most accurate way to date a pregnancy in the first trimester when the fetus is small. As the pregnancy progresses, femur length and biparietal diameter become more reliable. Abdominal circumference is less accurate in the first trimester. Serum beta-hCG is not useful for dating.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 14-year-old boy with symptoms of a runny nose, sneezing attacks, nasal obstruction, and itching that occur seasonally in the springtime. His brother has a history of asthma. The question asks which of the following diseases has a similar pathophysiology.

Based on the description, this patient likely has seasonal allergic rhinitis. The symptoms of a runny nose, sneezing, nasal obstruction, and itching that occur seasonally in the springtime are classic for seasonal allergic rhinitis. 

The choices describe different types of contact dermatitis and systemic autoimmune diseases. Allergic contact dermatitis involves an immune reaction to an external allergen. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that often presents in childhood. Irritant contact dermatitis involves an immune reaction to an irritant. Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a skin condition associated with celiac disease.

Of the choices given, allergic contact dermatitis is the most similar to seasonal allergic rhinitis in terms of the immune-mediated reaction to an external allergen.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 46-year-old man with a 3-day history of productive cough, fever, and purulent sputum who develops bloody vomiting, altered mental status, petechiae, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and elevated D-dimer. 

The key findings are:
- Fever, productive cough, purulent sputum - suggests bacterial pneumonia
- Bloody vomiting, altered mental status - suggests disseminated/severe infection
- Petechiae, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy - suggests DIC 
- Elevated D-dimer - supports DIC

The prolonged PT, PTT, and thrombocytopenia point towards DIC as the most likely cause of his ecchymoses. The other choices can cause thrombocytopenia but are less likely given the clinical picture.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 46-year-old man with a 3-day history of productive cough, fever, and purulent sputum who develops bloody vomiting, altered mental status, petechiae, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and elevated D-dimer. 

The key findings are:
- Fever, productive cough, purulent sputum - suggests bacterial pneumonia
- Bloody vomiting, altered mental status - suggests disseminated/severe infection
- Petechiae, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy - suggests DIC 
- Elevated D-dimer - supports DIC

The prolonged PT, PTT, and thrombocytopenia point towards DIC as the most likely cause of his ecchymoses. The other choices can cause thrombocytopenia but are less likely given the clinical picture.

This is a clinical vignette describing a 46-year-old man with a 3-day history of productive cough, fever, and purulent sputum who develops bloody vomiting, altered mental status, and petechiae. He has a history of thrombocytopenia. Lab tests show elevated D-dimer and prolonged PT/PTT. 

The key findings here are the thrombocytopenia, prolonged PT/PTT, and elevated D-dimer, which indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC can lead to widespread microvascular thrombosis and hemorrhage. The petechiae and bleeding are consistent with DIC.

The other answer choices can be ruled out:
- Immune thrombocytopenic purpura would not cause prolonged PT/PTT or elevated D-dimer. 
- Severe hepatic dysfunction may cause thrombocytopenia but would not explain the bleeding.
- Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura also would not cause prolonged PT/PTT or elevated D-dimer.
- Hemolytic uremic syndrome may cause thrombocytopenia but would not explain the bleeding or prolonged PT/PTT.
